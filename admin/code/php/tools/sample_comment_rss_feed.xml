		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing - I especially enjoyed hearing how supportive Mike was. You&#039;re very lucky to have each other - and now Daniel&#039;s lucky, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, the photo that caught my eye the most was the picture of the wrinkly bottoms of his feet! &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>Charlotte, what a fantastic story and Mike took such lovely photos -- I love the one of Daniel&#039;s feet!  I had back labor too, but the epidural unfortunately didn&#039;t touch it at all.  I can&#039;t believe you made it so far in the process before calling for the epidural.  Aren&#039;t our bodies amazing?</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing this story and the beautiful breath-taking pictures. Someone once said the moment a mother meets her child is holy. I couldn&#039;t agree more. The pictures really depict that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>Well said. I feared up just remembering my own deliveries and those first moments with the new one. I love delivery (ie epidurals). He&#039;s beautiful and so are you.</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Congrats again Char!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#039;s so adorable- and he definitely has his mommy&#039;s chin :-) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this, I was thinking 1) how beautiful this new chapter in your life is and 2) how wonderful it has been to be able to follow you in livejournal, facebook etc for more than 10 years!  Your outlook and posts are always so positive. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing more photos of weddings in DC and your family. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So glad you had a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, too, found that watching my pushes in a mirror helped.  I didn&#039;t want to look, but Ben said that my pushing got much better when I did.  And honestly - even without having an epidural I can echo your sentiments of that pushing feeling being more about pressure than pain...after the double peak contractions I had with transition, the pushing felt almost like a good sneeze. LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#039;s beautiful.  You did a great job.  Congratulations again :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The one of you holding Daniel while crying makes my heart completely melt. That one photos says it all.... I can&#039;t tell you how happy I am for you and Mike. Love and hugs from Colorado :)</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, Charlotte - I&#039;m so very happy for you!&lt;br /&gt;
Your lovely story and pix brought me to tears.&lt;br /&gt;
There&#039;s absolutely nothing on this earth as profound as the rush of love and elation a Mother experiences on seeing her child for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;

Thank you for sharing these precious moments!&lt;br /&gt;
Blessings to you all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
