He\\\'s brilliant with dogs.  Mike and I met her on Saturday at the CO Springs humane society shelter.  We took a day to think it over, and today I went to sign the paperwork.  After work today, he\\\'ll come with me to pick her up and take her home.  Right now she is sitting in that cage, waiting for someone to love her.

I took these first two pics with my cell phone, because I forgot my camera.  d\\\'oh.  The rest of the pictures were taken with my pocket camera, because I didn\\\'t want our whirling dervish to get near my equipment, at least not yet!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1ally.JPG\\\">This is probably the best photo to give you an idea of what Ally looks like.  Her coloring is so pretty!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1blurrydog.JPG\\\">But this is what she actually looks like most of the time.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1allymike.JPG\\\">We took her into our backyard and waited for our cats inside to start to notice her out the window.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1allychar.JPG\\\">Ally was so happy to be there with us!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1allycharlick.JPG\\\">She was a bit energetic, to say the least.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/1wtf.JPG\\\">And the cats definitely noticed. <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/2mikeplay2.JPG\\\">We continued to play with Ally outside the patio door.  The cats promptly fled to the basement.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/2lurewithtreats.JPG\\\">I lured the cats out with treats.  The sound of the treats rattling in their container worked temporarily and brought them out of hiding.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/2mikeplay.JPG\\\">But this was just not acceptable behavior for their backyard.  They fled back into the basement, calling us bitches under their breath.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/3lurewithsalmon.JPG\\\">It was time for the big guns.  I bribed them out of the basement with salmon.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/4dogarea.JPG\\\">After the cats watched the dog out the window for a while, we decided to let them outside, too.  Fortunately we have a separate area of the backyard that is fenced in for a dog.  We put Ally in there to keep her separated from the cats.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/4lureoutside.JPG\\\">Of course the cats weren\\\'t going anywhere without a bribe.  A request like this required both salmon AND treats.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/4deck.JPG\\\">My little trooper, Janie, came out and ignored the bribes.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/5janiefluffy.JPG\\\">Janie made herself as big and scary as possible.  ROWR!

Pansy boy.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/7babygate.JPG\\\">Finally we brought Ally inside and sequestered her to the basement.  Our makeshift babygate kept her away from the cats.  Not that it mattered much, because they promptly hid under the bed for a few hours.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/7luretogate.JPG\\\">Eventually I decided some tuna would get them out from under the bed.  I put the tuna at the top of the stairs, to get them a little closer to the dog in the basement.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/8janieencounter.JPG\\\">Of course Ally smelled the tuna, too, and she ran up and scared the crap out of the cats.  We gave her treats in the basement and let the cats eat their bribe in peace.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/01_24_dogadoptionday/9sleepy.JPG\\\">Now Roger and Janie are nestled safely under the bed again, and Ally is finally getting tired.

	(12,1,'Ugh... what a day.  Two days ago, our kitty Janie got attacked by a neighborhood cat that jumped our fence into our backyard.  We didn\\\'t realize that she was injured until last night, when we found her hiding in a closet and nearly lethargic.  We found bad wounds on her hind paws and called the emergency vet.  They said she was infected and sick and needed to come in to the ER immediately.At 11pm, we arrived at the all-night vet.At 2am, we left the vet with a morphined, bandaged kitty and 300 fewer dollars.  At 2:30am, I went to sleep.  I was sick and restless all night, still miserable from my congestion.At 6:45am, I woke up, feeling miserable still.At 8:00am, I got together with a bride and groom to take their wedding portraits at the Broadmoor resort.  It was already about 80 degrees and very sunny.  I was not feeling mentally or physically alert.At 8:15am, I realized I had forgotten to put on deodorant.  Let\\\'s just say I wasn\\\'t giving off my most professional image.At 9:30am, I got home and went back to bed.  At 12:30pm, I woke up to the sounds of our regular vet calling.  Bring Janie in right away, they said.  We got her report from the emergency room, and we don\\\'t agree with her prescription.At 1:00, I got dressed and ready to go to the vet.  In my sleepy and sick state, I packed up my camera instead of my cat.At 1:05, I went back for the cat.At 1:30, I find out that our regular vet disagrees with just about everything we paid $300 for last night.  He gave us new prescriptions, took off her bandages, and told us never to go back to that ER.At 6:30 tonight I have a meeting with a prospective bride.  I am not feeling at all capable of being interviewed, but I\\\'ll bring some Puffs Plus and put on a happy face.  It\\\'s the best I can do.  I\\\'d better run out now so I can get there in time.UPDATE:The meeting was a mess tonight.  I was so disorganized.  I chose to meet at a coffee shop that was closed!  I brought an album that was empty!  I dropped all my loose prints on the street!  I had a coughing fit in the middle of the meeting!  This has not been my day at all.  The good news is that the bride really seemed to like me and my work, so I might get the job anyway.  She was a lot of fun, and I think I\\\'d really enjoy her wedding.  She is meeting with another photographer next week, and she says she\\\'ll get back to me after that.  Sigh.  I am going to force myself to go to bed now instead of work on the computer all night.

Mike took Monday and Tuesday off for an adventure in the wilderness.  We visited  Boulder, Estes Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, Shadow Mountain Lake, and Lake Granby.  Last night we camped on the shores of Lake Granby and the winding rivers that feed into it.  Now that the mountain snows are melting, the lakes are rushing and gorgeous.  Mike\\\'s friend Tom is visiting from England, and he joined us for the weekend.  He has never been to the United States before, and what a beautiful state for his first visit!  It was a fun weekend, but we certainly had our share of dangers.<b>Moose Adventure, Day 1</b>On Sunday, Mike got charged by a moose at our campsite.  He was reaching into a bush to retrieve our dog\\\'s baseball when a female moose appeared out of nowhere and ran straight toward him.  Those things are enormous and will stamp you to death if angry enough.  Mike ran and jumped on the nearest picnic table.  Our dog, Ally, ran out and started barking at the moose, and Tom ran out to see what was going on.  The moose must have decided that she was outnumbered, and she turned and left.  Mike was fine, but definitely shaken.  I missed the whole thing, because I was turned the other direction, taking pictures of a baby horse.  Of course.  My beloved is nearly trampled to death, and I don\\\'t even notice because I am looking at the cute little horsie.  Oh, the shame.  Thank god he was ok.  It could have been horrible.<b>Moose Adventure, Day 2</b>On Monday, we went hiking at a lake, and Ally charged a different moose.  She ran right after it with no fear.  I think she was trying to protect us.  What a moronic dog.  I swear, she is frightened of terriers and dachshunds, but she will charge a freakin\\\' moose in the wild.  She ran into a mass of tall bushes toward the moose, and none of us could see where she had gone.  Then we heard her barking, sounding panicked.  Then silence.  We called out to Ally, but she didn\\\'t respond.  I was terrified, and ran toward the bushes.  Then I realized that I couldn\\\'t see through the foliage, and I didn\\\'t want to get myself hurt by any moose, either.  Helpless, I returned to the trail, and called out to Ally.  We looked for her for about ten minutes or so, which doesn\\\'t sound like a long time, but when you are terrified that your dog has been stomped by a moose, that is an eternity.  I started crying.  Finally Mike called out that he had found Ally and she was ok.  I ran to her, both happy to see her and really pissed off at her.  What kind of moronic 60-pound dog charges a 1000-pound moose?!Just as I was accepting the fact that our dog was ok and I could stop crying, the little canine freak ran straight to the nearby rushing river and jumped right in the turbulent water.  I freaked out again.  Mike ran after her, knowing fully well that he wouldn\\\'t be able to jump in after her.  Fortunately Ally, the Wonder Idiot, grabbed onto a tree and pulled herself out.  We promptly put her on a leash for the rest of the day.  <b>Overall Experience</b>On a happier note, we really did have a great time this weekend, and I have rediscovered the joy of camping.  Colorado is a fantastic state that really takes care of its natural beauty and the public\\\'s access to it.  I\\\'ll never have enough time to see all the parks in this state, but I hope to keep trying.As you probably have guessed, I took a lot of pictures (500 in two days), so after I get caught up with all my work, I\\\'ll sort through them and post a few here.  <b>Our return</b>I am not a princess who can\\\'t get dirty, but then again, I\\\'m not a rugged outdoorswoman, either.  It\\\'s funny to realize my three priorities upon leaving camp today, in order:1. A clean ladies\\\' room2. A decent meal3. A large vanilla skim latte<b>Unrelated final note</b>I\\\'m an American Idol junkie.  I\\\'m actually sad that tomorrow is the end of the season, and I\\\'ll have to wait until next winter for more.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:18','2005-05-25 05:14:00','The Weekend of Charging Moose','the-weekend-of-charging-moose.html','/2005/5/25/',1),

He is able to jump our 6-foot fence, but he doesn\\\'t usually stray further than our yard,  I was terrified that something had happened to him.  After all, there is an evil cat in our neighborhood that chewed up our other kitty, Janie, a couple weeks ago.  That frightening experience is still fresh in my mind.  On top of that, we live very near mountain wilderness, and there are mountain lions, bears, and god knows what else in this area.  Roger is a big cat.  Big.  I mean 17 pounds of giant black feline with claws that haven\\\'t been trimmed lately, which might make him intimidating to other animals.  But he is also a big sissy lapcat, as you may recall from <a href=\\\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/charlottegeary/15190.html\\\"><b>this post</b></a>.  At midnight I wandered around our neighborhood in my bathrobe, shaking a bag of kitty treats.  Roger, come on out Roger.  Mike got in his car and drove through the neighborhood streets, looking for any signs that he had been hit by a car.  Nothing.  I sat on our front curb, shaking those treats and feeling miserable.  How could I lose my cat?  In the last two weeks I have been a horrible pet mom.  Janie got attacked when I let her out after dark.  Ally chased after a moose and jumped in a raging river when I let her off her leash.  Now Roger was gone and I hadn\\\'t even noticed that he was missing all day.I slept on the sofa that night, hoping Roger would come home and try to scratch at the window.  I was so sad.At 2:30, a frantic scratching woke me up.  I jumped off the sofa and saw a little black feline face looking in the window at me with spooked eyes.  Roger was home.  I scooped him up, gave him some dinner, and took him to bed.  He seemed unharmed, so I guess he just got lost.  I hope he learned his lesson!  Meanwhile I still feel guilty.

We thought Tom should try a big American steak, so we took him to the place where everything is cooked in a thin layer of tasty crack.  I ate a huge dinner of coconut shrimp, salmon, and two Wallaby Darneds before I realized that I was not in fact fully recovered from my flu.  Ugh.  Stomach not happy.We left the restaurant to meet up with some friends at a bar downtown, but I should have gone home instead.  Mike really wanted to go out, though, and Tom hadn\\\'t been out for any nightlife the whole time he has been here.  So tried to grin and bear it.  We parked several blocks from the bar, just as the sky opened and dropped sheets of rain.  I hobbled through the streets, cold, wet, sick, and hormonal.  By the time we got to the bar, I was ready to turn around and go back to the car.  Only the rain kept me there long enough for the guys to have a beer.  I was hoping it would let up outside first.  I felt so weak that I could barely stand.  The booming speakers shook my body and made my stomach want to leap out of my mouth.  On top of everything, I had the kind of brutal cramps that could make a girl \\\"accidentally\\\" throw someone through a plate glass window.  Unfortunately this bar had several windows and a crowd of potential victims.  It could have been very bad.  Finally I told the guys that I really needed to go.  Mike sprinted to the car in the downpour, and came back to pick us up.  The poor guy was soaked and freezing, but he didn\\\'t want me to have to walk in that rain again.  His thoughtfulness lifted my spirits.  No matter how cranky and miserable I am, he\\\'s good to me.Today I\\\'m feeling better, but I have no desire to eat anything.

I got my hair cut and styled, my nails done, and then a massage.  It was my first manicure in a few years, and my first massage ever.  Mmmmmm.... massage... it was heaven.  I couldn\\\'t believe how quickly an hour went by.  I was just glowing with tranquility and joy afterward.  I think I have to become an addict now.

He had us rolling in the grass, running through fields, leaning sexily against rocks, and laughing pretty much nonstop.

Today I had to make a lot of calls for my wedding planning--the florist, registrar, salon, and house sitter--and I did everything I could to procrastinate.  I cleaned the kitchen.  I made a double latte.  I surfed the entire internets, all of them.  I even watched CNN, trying to convince myself that news is important and I should watch it.  But now I\\\'ve made most of my calls, and it feels good to check those things off my to-do list.  Everytime I finish a phone call, I always say to myself, \\\"Hmm, that wasn\\\'t so bad after all.\\\"2. It\\\'s weird to be getting married and have a new present on my doorstep every day.  I still can\\\'t believe that we get to keep all this stuff.  Yesterday we got a set of gorgeous silver candlesticks. The day before it was a fondue maker.

	(41,1,'I had a bizarre afternoon.  On my way home from Kinkos (and yes, I brought the dog), <b>I witnessed a car accident</b>.  An RV ran a stop sign and hit a little sedan. Thank god it wasn\\\'t a severe crash, because there were two small children in the backseat of the sedan.  I parked my car so I could give an eye witness statement to the police.The driver of the sedan was hysterical and her two little kids were sobbing.  The kids seemed to be unharmed, thank god, but their mom appeared to have an injured neck or back.  The RV hit the front driver side, so she was affected most.  She wasn\\\'t in any shape to help her kids out of the car, and she didn\\\'t want them to go anywhere until her sister arrived, but it was 91 degrees outside.  Way too hot for anyone to sit inside a parked car.  So I sprinted to a nearby liquor store and bought all of them cold bottles of water.  The children chugged that water.The sister/aunt arrived shortly thereafter and took care of the kids.  I gave her my name and number, and then rushed off to my car to take care of my own kid.  Little Ally Dog was so hot in the backseat!  I gave her a cold bottle of water, too, and took her outside in the shade.  Then we sat and waited for the police to arrive.<b>The paramedics came, and took the driver away on a stretcher</b>.  I don\\\'t really know what her injuries were; I was trying to stay out of the way as much as possible.  But her sister took the two kids and her own daughter to sit in the shade.  They were so grateful to me for waiting.And waiting.  And waiting.  We had to call the police four times, because they just weren\\\'t getting there.  In the meanwhile, <b>I befriended a homeless lady named Fire</b> who lives in her car at that intersection.  She had a couple folding chairs in her car, and offered me one.  She had a dog, too, and our doggies became friends.  Then another relative of the accident victim arrived with their tiny puppy.  All together there were several adult relatives, three kids, me, Fire, three dogs, and a decent breeze.  And a loooooong wait.  The family in the RV stayed inside their vehicle.Can you freaking believe that <b>it took an hour and a half for the cops to arrive</b>?!  Apparently the problem was that the accident occurred near the border between Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs, so the cops didn\\\'t know which squad to send.  So they didn\\\'t send anyone!  We had to call four times before anyone showed up.  On the third call, the police told us that they couldn\\\'t help us if we didn\\\'t know the zip code of the intersection.  Give me a damn break.  Thank god for my trusty T-Mobile Sidekick, because I Googled the motel across the street and was able to get a zip code.  The police used that zip code to decide which cop to send.  What little buggers.Finally a police officer came, and I gave him a written statement.  The victim\\\'s husband was so grateful to me that he actually offered to take Mike and me out for a beer to say thanks.  It thought that was nice.  I just told him to pay it forward.  Now Ally and I are home, and it\\\'s hot.  I might crack open a <b>cold alcoholic beverage</b>.

She held the phone up to her car speakers for the entire duration of \\\"Unchained Melody\\\" in Italian.  She thought I had to hear it.

	(53,1,'Hello from my favorite (huge) internet cafe in Kensington.  We\\\'ve had a great day today!  Thursday wasn\\\'t so great.  Here is a long summary of the events of the last couple days.<!--more Bridezilla at the Airport--><b>Bridezilla at the Airport</b>On Thursday afternoon we arrived at Dulles airport, and Mike took fun pictures of me, my mom, and my aunt posing with our mountain of luggage.  The good cheer ended promptly when Virgin Airlines security got very rude with us about our apparently misused definition of ticket vs. e-ticket.  She refused to let us through, because of a stupid misunderstanding of our reservations.  She was very obnoxious, and my temper flared.  I was pissed.  I yelled at her in an very uncharacteristic manner that surprised Mike and my parents, and that caused me to be labelled as a security risk.  They pulled my luggage aside and covered it with neon stickers announcing my risky status.  I watched as she took the box that housed my wedding gown, and covered it with these stickers that said \\\"Do Not Load.\\\"  You just don\\\'t do that to a bride.  At least not while she\\\'s watching.  Suddenly I was certain that my gown would not be loaded on the plane. I started to freak a bit more.  She was so cold to me, even when I explained that we were heading to our wedding and I was concerned about my gown.  But at least she let us through to check-in.At check-in, the staff said that Mike and I didn\\\'t have any reservations.  We had a printed confirmation of tickets purchased three months ago, but somehow those reservations weren\\\'t included in Virgin\\\'s computers.  That\\\'s when I started to cry.My mom pulled out an AmEx card and said to the staff, \\\"FIX IT.\\\"  I told them all that we were going to our wedding and we needed to get on that plane.  One of the guys behind the counter said, \\\"OHHHHH... now I get it.  I got married once, too, and I remember how that went.\\\"  Then they started to be nice to us.  Finally.  Mike congratulated me for handling a stressful situation, \\\"almost without crying.\\\"  After lengthy security checks of our luggage and ourselves, we got through.  My gown was even approved for loading.  Mike thought I might need a mocha frappucino, stat.  He took me to an airport Starbucks, where I requested no whipped cream. They gave me whipped cream anyway.  I was pissed, and Mike was scared.  He grabbed my drink, pulled off the top, scooped up all the whipped cream, and shoved it in his mouth swiftly.  Then he put the top back on and handed it to me like nothing had happened.  I started laughing and immediately felt better.On our way to the plane, Mike said to me, \\\"Look on the bright side.  You can write all this down and it will be a funny blog.\\\"  That\\\'s my boy.<b>London Security</b>You\\\'d never know by casual observation that any bombings had happened here so recently.  People here in London are just carrying on like normal.  The only outward sign that anything is different is that there are lots of heavily-armed police in the city.  That is a very strange sight here in England.  Something else that I\\\'ve noticed is that people are really jumpy around abandoned bags.  Just twice today I\\\'ve had people ask me whether a bag is mine.  I don\\\'t blame them.<b>Feeling Like a Londoner</b>I realized today that this is my seventh trip to London, and my ninth trip to England.  I\\\'m only 30 years old, and I\\\'ve been to England nine times.  That\\\'s pretty amazing.  Mike has been away all weekend, and it\\\'s really funny how my family keeps asking me things about London and England, as though I\\\'m a local.  And most of the time I can answer.  It\\\'s cool how comfortable I am here.  I know to look to the right before crossing the street, to order \\\"skimmed\\\" milk instead of nonfat, and to specify \\\"eat in\\\" or \\\"take out\\\" at sandwich or coffee shops.  When I take coins out of my pocket, I can pay without looking at the numbers on each coin.  I don\\\'t even carry my camera around with me, because this place feels so homey to me that I no longer have that tourist feeling.  It\\\'s nice.  <b>Fighting Crime</b>This afternoon I was walking around London by myself on a mostly deserted street.  Suddenly I heard a lady yelling, \\\"Stop him!\\\"  I looked up, and saw a man running toward me with his hands full of something.  A small lady was running behind him, still shouting to me to stop this guy.  There was no one else on the street, so I reached out to grab the guy as he ran by.  Just as my arms reached around him, I snatched them back and decided not to touch him after all.  I didn\\\'t know what he had done and whether he was violent, and I didn\\\'t want to get myself in any danger by grabbing him.  Somehow I managed to fluster him enough that he just dropped whatever it was that he had been holding.  Then he continued running.  The lady caught up to me and thanked me profusely.  I told her that I didn\\\'t actually do anything, because I didn\\\'t know if he would hurt me.  She said that whatever I did had worked, because she got her stuff back.  She picked up the things he dropped, which turned out to be shoes.  Apparently he had shoplifted a pair of wooden shoes from her homeopathic healing goods store.  She was so grateful to me for helping her, but I really didn\\\'t do anything but startle a thief.  I guess that was good enough.So today I helped to stop a crime.  I didn\\\'t even have to touch the guy--I must have superpowers.  I made the streets of London a little safer today, so I rewarded myself for my good deed with veggie sushi.<b>The Producers</b>My parents, aunt, and I went to see The Producers today!  It was absolutely hilarious.  Before the end of the first act, my stomach was already hurting from laughing so much.  By the \\\"Springtime for Hitler\\\" scene in the second act, I was almost wheezing.  It was even funnier than I could have imagined.  If you haven\\\'t seen it yet, go!<b>Cold Weather</b>I just got back from shopping for sweaters. In July!  It is so cold here, I had no idea.  It\\\'s probably in the 40s at night, and no higher than 70 during the days.  I brought no long-sleeve shirts, and only one sweater.  The crazy thing is that most places have their air conditioning on!  My hands are freezing right now at the internet cafe.  <b>Bachelor Parties</b>Mike is on his bachelor party all weekend.  He left last night and (hopefully) will come back tomorrow after he is able to wake up.  I really hope his friends don\\\'t torture him too much.  Our hotel is across the street from Kensington Palace.  I told Mike that I\\\'d spend the weekend looking for the princes, so I could have my own bachelor party in his absence.  He didn\\\'t like that idea much.  OK, that\\\'s more than enough for now!  I hope you all are doing well!  I\\\'m reading most of your posts, but haven\\\'t had a chance to respond.  Thank you to all of you for your send-offs and congratulations!  :-D','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:20','2005-07-24 02:29:00','Hello from London','hello-from-london.html','/2005/7/24/',1),

All guests were evacuated from the hotel, but my father managed to escape with my gown, just in case!

Nope.  When it was our turn to cut a wedding cake, we cut an enormous wedge.  Evidently the custom in England is just to cut the cake for the cameras and then stop.  In America the fun part is feeding the cake to each other, of course!  But our English wedding venue did not provide us with a plate or a fork.  So we just took the huge piece of cake into our hands and shoved it into our mouths.

On the plane ride to Italy, I was so exhausted that I just crashed.  So almost everything in Italy was a surprise to us.  The huge Milan Castle was one such surprise.  We knew almost nothing about Milan before we arrived, so we had a great time wandering the city and discovering each sight.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/char_castle.jpg\\\">In this picture, I\\\'m saying something like, \\\"oooh, big castle, drawbridge, iron gate!\\\"  Mike thinks it\\\'s really funny that Americans like castles so much.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/statuesun.jpg\\\">Inside the castle\\\'s main courtyard.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/fountain.jpg\\\">This fountain marks the center of the entire castle compound.  Or at least Mike told me so.  I didn\\\'t read the guidebook.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/davinciceiling.jpg\\\">This ceiling was my favorite part of the castle.  Unfortunately the photo does it absolutely no justice.  This room was painted to look like a dense forest, with tree trunks rising up the walls, and branches and leaves intertwined in elaborate twists on the ceiling.  I was even more enthralled when we realized that Leonardo da Vinci had painted it.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/char_lookingatceiling.jpg\\\">Here I am, standing in the center of the room, spinning around as I take in each detail of the ceiling.  I wish Mike had taken a picture of me wobbling in dizziness afterward.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/statuecolumns3.jpg\\\">A cool statue in one of the castle courtyards.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/statuecolumns2.jpg\\\">I liked that statue and the columns.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/mike_beer.jpg\\\">Afterward we went for our afternoon cafe break.  This time Mike ordered a birra.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/char_latte.jpg\\\">Here I am with my cappuccino grande.  I was thrilled to see such a huge coffee!  Most of the coffee drinks in Italy are really small, at least compared to my tall/grande/venti standards from Starbucks.  On one of our first days in Italy, Mike cracked me up by saying, \\\"I like American coffee better.\\\"  I asked why.  \\\"Because you get more of it.\\\"<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/mike_prada.jpg\\\">We did a little shopping, because it would be a shame for me to go to Milan and not buy some fabulous fashion of some sort.  I bought a tank top for 20 Euros, because our budget doesn\\\'t really accommodate anything more fabulous than that.  But we did window shop at some high fashion shops.  Here is Mike outside of Prada.  You can tell by his expression that he doesn\\\'t get it.  Neither do I.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Milan/bathroom.jpg\\\">Our hotel room had a TV in the bathroom.

We spent only one evening in Pisa, which turned out to be enough time to see the sights (namely, the tower and cathedral).  The city itself wasn\\\'t particularly interesting, especially during August, when it seemed that everything was closed for summer holidays.  The tower was very cool, though.  No matter how many times we\\\'d seen it in photos, we just weren\\\'t prepared for the alarming sight of this tipping structure.<!--more More photos from Pisa-->Because we were in town only for an evening, I left my SLR in the hotel and took my pocket camera to dinner with us.  I wish I had brought the big camera, though, because we ended up having some gorgeous sunlight that I would have enjoyed playing with!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Pisa/mikechar_river.jpg\\\">At the river through the center of town.  Most of the windows of the city\\\'s buildings were shuttered up for the entire month of August, when most northern Italians go on their summer holidays.  The town felt deserted, except for the incessant tourists, of course.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Pisa/mike_tower.jpg\\\">Look Ma, it\\\'s leaning!It doesn\\\'t really tilt quite this much.

It was dizzying.

We decided to stray from Italian cuisine for a night, and chose Chinese instead.  This restaurant was full of Chinese people, which is usually a good sign when choosing a Chinese restaurant.  Our meal here was one of the biggest of our trip, and definitely the cheapest.  It was about half the cost of any other restaurant on our trip.  It was a fun change of pace from all the spaghetti al pomodoro!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Pisa/char_gelato.jpg\\\">We did stick with Italian cuisine for dessert, of course.  Mmmmm, gelato. <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Pisa/cathedral_night.jpg\\\">After plenty of wine, we took our ice cream and strolled tipsily through the cathedral square on the way back to the hotel.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:21','2005-08-21 19:25:00','Pisa','pisa.html','/2005/8/21/',1),

We climbed high trails along terraced vineyards and olive groves, high above the ocean.  At the end of our hike was a beautiful seaside village that felt like the promised land.<!--more More photos from the Cinque Terra--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Cinque%20Terra/cliffjumper.jpg\\\">We started in the town of Monterosso, the northern most of the five villages in the area.  We ate lunch at a seaside cafe and watched cliff jumpers.  Look closely at the lower center of this photo, and you\\\'ll see a teenager jumping off the cliffs.  The trail leading up the hill is the one we took to start our hike.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Cinque%20Terra/vineyards.jpg\\\">The hike was beautiful.  We followed terrace vineyards that were built into the steep cliffs, hundreds of feet above the water below.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Cinque%20Terra/cliffs_vernazza.jpg\\\">After tough climbs and hot sunshine, we were happy to see our destination village of Vernazza in the distance.

This city is an aesthetic and cultural delight, full of gorgeous artwork, architecture, and fashion.  We spent two days there, in a fabulous hotel near the heart of the city.<!--more Photos of Florence by day--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/astoria.jpg\\\">Our hotel was incredible!  I wish that I had taken photos inside.  It had a marble staircase, huge tapestries, gilded walls, sculptures, elaborate ceilings, and an overall feeling of grandeur.  It was definitely the coolest hotel I\\\'ve ever visited.  Mike did a good job planning this honeymoon!  He treated his new wifey in style.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/tower.jpg\\\">Our hotel was only a couple blocks from the Duomo.  This stunning cathedral is painted in peach, white, and black, giving it a crisp, cheerful appearance.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/mike_duomostairs.jpg\\\">Mike and I climbed to the top of the cathedral dome, which was around 480 hot, crowded, and inadequately ventilated steps.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/florence3.jpg\\\">But the view was definitely worth it!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/mikechar_duomo2.jpg\\\">Aw.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/academy.jpg\\\">The sculpture in the first photo (above) is called the Rape of the Sabine Women.  The sculpture in this photo shows a man holding the head of a woman he has decapitated.  Florence\\\'s art may be beautiful, but it is pretty horrific, too.  I actually had a nightmare about a decapitated head that night.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/duomo_ceiling.jpg\\\">In the realm of horrific art, the ceiling of the Florence Duomo (cathedral) takes the cake.  The inside of the dome is painted with a huge mural of the Last Judgment.  In this painting, believers go to heaven, while nonbelievers get tortured in hell.  If you look closely, you\\\'ll see that some of the nonbelievers are actually getting raped by burning rods.  And this is shown in a *church*.  I couldn\\\'t imagine taking children to church each week, and having them stare at paintings of demon rape.  But maybe that\\\'s just me.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/gelato.jpg\\\">On a happier note, mmmm, gelato.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/pinkclothes.jpg\\\">Yikes, Italian fashion.  You won\\\'t believe me, but I took this photo in the MEN\\\'S section of a department store.  In Italy, the two most popular men\\\'s colors seem to be pink and orange.  The stores are full of all shades of pink for men, with outfits such as a pale pink shirt with hot pink capri pants.  Yes, capris for men.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Florence/uffizi2.jpg\\\">The Uffizi gallery.

I loved this gorgeous, walled city!  It was everything that I imagine a medieval city should be.  I felt like I was in the midst of a huge renaissance festival, only the setting was authentic.  Somehow I couldn\\\'t accept the reality of this beautiful place--it was too perfect and charming not to be a movie set.  I almost expected a king and his juggling jester to appear on one of the balconies overhead.<!--more More photos from Siena--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/torre_del_mangia.jpg\\\">The city center, the Piazza del Campo, is a huge, semi-circular piazza facing this town hall building.  Mike and I began our tour of the city by climbing the tower, the Torre del Mangia.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/char_towerstairs.jpg\\\">After a long wait at the bottom of the tower, we were finally allowed to climb the narrow and winding stairs to the top.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/mike_towerstairs2.jpg\\\">As far as European towers go, this staircase was actually spacious and comfy.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/tuscany2.jpg\\\">The top of the tower offered breathtaking views of Siena and the Tuscany countryside.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/siena1.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/siena4.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/church.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/roadoverwall.jpg\\\">I got such a kick out of this sight!

I am a lucky girl indeed.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/flags.jpg\\\">We climbed back down the tower to the Piazza del Campo.  The city was preparing for its semiannual horse races around the square.  We missed the races by 6 days, but we did see lots of competitors\\\' flags on sale in preparation.  Apparently there are 19 local groups in Siena that have been rivals for centuries.  They are represented by their own colorful emblems and flags.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/children_flags.jpg\\\">The piazza was full of little girls dancing with their souvenir flags.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/children_flags2.jpg\\\">The little boys had other uses for their flags. <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/pizzicheria.jpg\\\">A butcher shop.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Siena/dogbackpack.jpg\\\">I had only a few seconds to take one photo of her.

Sure, the president\\\'s hugs are mostly a publicity stunt for the cameras, but it\\\'s a crucial publicity stunt.  We need to know that the government cares, and we haven\\\'t seen any sign of that all week.Most of you know that I am an eternal optimist.  I see the best in people, even if they don\\\'t necessarily deserve it.  When the government does something I don\\\'t approve of, such as invading Iraq, I trust that there something that the government knows that I don\\\'t.  I give them the benefit of the doubt.My trust is shattered this week.  I have never been so OUTRAGED at the government.  They have stranded people for FOUR DAYS, without food, clean water, medicine, or liveable conditions.  People are DYING.  They have left them to DIE.  I am absolutely horrified at my own nation\\\'s inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to send help where needed.  It doesn\\\'t count to drop supplies from a helicopter, so the victims can watch their precious water bottles shatter on the sidewalk.  Sure, there is a security risk to the aid workers.  There is a huge number of violent idiots that are ruining the rescue efforts for everyone else.  There are actually reports of them shooting at rescuers--what the hell??  But the military should be there anyway.  The vast majority of victims are normal, decent people--children, parents, tourists, the elderly, the sick--who NEED help immediately.  Isn\\\'t that the purpose of the military anyway--to accomplish missions during potentially unsafe situations?  They are trained in warfare after all!  Surely they can handle street gangs.  Let me phrase this in a way that might make sense to the President: Mr. President, if you want the world to respect US peace-keeping efforts and fear the US military, then you are doing a terrible job.  How chickenshit does our military look if they are afraid of New Orleans street gangs?  How selfish and inhumane does the US government look if it won\\\'t help its own people?At least help is starting to arrive.  I\\\'m watching amphibious supply convoys arriving in NOLA on CNN right now.  But they should have been there Tuesday, not Friday.

As though the city weren\\\'t pretty enough already, there is a lovely mountain range in the distance.  I stood here and thought how the mountains in the background reminded me of Colorado Springs, but the ancient Roman buildings in the foreground reminded me that there is no place like Rome.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/Colosseum1.jpg\\\">The Colosseum!  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/Colosseum_umbrella.jpg\\\">Rome is a fascinating mix of old and new.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/Colosseum_gate.jpg\\\">We didn\\\'t actually go in the Colosseum, due to long lines and high prices, but we did walk all the way around it and peer inside the walls.  It\\\'s hard to imagine that something so magnificient as this ancient structure was built to glorify violence.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/Colosseum_moon.jpg\\\">The moon peeking around the Colosseum.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/Pantheon_char2.jpg\\\">The Pantheon was one of my favorite spots in Rome.  This building, originally a temple to all gods (\\\"pan-theon\\\"), has stood intact for almost 2000 years.  Its condition is almost pristine.  The only light in the building comes from the hole in the ceiling, known as the oculus.  The floor slopes gently toward the door, to let rainwater out.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/Italy/Rome/RomanForum.jpg\\\">The Roman Forum.

	(84,1,'Now that we have our wedding video, it\\\'s time for me to share my favorite story from our wedding day.  It\\\'s time for the Stand By Me Story!Our wedding had a series of mishaps throughout the day.  The biggest problem of all was that our DJ hadn\\\'t brought ANY of the music I had requested.  We had no music at all for the ceremony!  No first dance song!  No father-daughter dance song!  Nothing at all that I had asked for.  I discovered this problem about an hour before the wedding started.  My wonderful friend, Melanie, saved the day by running around town and collecting CDs with any sort of classical music or love songs.  15 minutes before the ceremony began, she was hunched over a CD player, choosing songs for the processional, the signing of the register, and the recessional.  She played DJ throughout the wedding, and did a wonderful job.  I am so grateful to her!  The ceremony went beautifully.  We didn\\\'t have any of the songs I had imagined would be in our wedding, but it really didn\\\'t matter.  Everything was great anyway.  We headed off to the reception and had a wonderful time.  It didn\\\'t occur to me until about 10 minutes before our first dance that the DJ might not have our requested song--Stand By Me, by Ben E. King.  I asked him--surely he\\\'d have it on some oldies compilation CD, I thought.  Apparently not.I hurried off to tell my maid of honor, Sarah, that we didn\\\'t have our song for the dance.  I asked her what she thought we should do.  Without hesitating, she said, \\\"We\\\'ll sing it!\\\"  I laughed.  Ha ha, that\\\'s funny, Sarah.  She always cheers me up.  OK, seriously, what should we do?  She was serious.  She ran off to consult with some of Mike\\\'s friends.Within 5 minutes, we had a choir of about 15 people on the dance floor.  Mike and I stood in awe as our beloved friends and family started singing, \\\"bum bum ba da dum dum... When the night has come...\\\"  Once again, our friends had saved the day.  They continued singing as Mike and I spun around the dance floor, singing along with them.  Soon most of the people in the whole room were singing, too.  \\\"Darling! Darling!  Staaaaand By Me!\\\"  It was priceless.  We all laughed, and sang, and danced.  Mike\\\'s friends linked arms with my friends and swayed side to side, and it was a touching show of friendship from all of them.  What a gift.  What a great song for such a gift, too--a song that is more about friendship than anything.  We are so lucky!Who wants to see the video?

Here\\\'s the story of our father-daughter dance:My mom and I chose \\\"Because You Loved Me\\\" by Celine Dion for my dance with my dad. Surprise, surprise, the DJ didn\\\'t bring it. So he had to improvise and find something to replace it. His choice:Some dance song called \\\"Murder on the Dance Floor!\\\" Here are some of the lyrics:Murder murder murder murder murderIt\\\'s murder on the dancefloor But you better not kill the groove Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down bwahahahahahaha! That song is absolutely NOTHING like \\\"Because You Loved Me.\\\" Here\\\'s a note to any DJs out there: If you screw up the father-daughter dance song, and you need to find a replacement, try to find a song that doesn\\\'t involve murder.

	(89,1,'Two years ago I bought a condo in the trendy neighborhood of Clarendon, in Arlington, Virginia.  It would take two years for the complex to be built, so I signed a purchase agreement with rights to cancel the purchase.Around the same time, I met Mike.  It was apparent to me from early on that he would be in my life for a long time.  Suddenly a 695 square foot apartment seemed too small for two.  Suddenly this single-girl-in-the-city had no clue where life would lead, and whether I\\\'d even live in the DC area within two years.I canceled the purchase.  I chose an uncertain future with Mike.  It was the right choice, obviously. My life is much better now with Mike than it ever was before, and my life has always been pretty good.Two years ago, when I bought and returned the condo, it cost $295,000.  Today I found out that it is now going for $465,000. If I had kept the condo and stayed in DC, I would have spent the last two years waiting for the complex to be built.  During that time, I would have earned $170,000 for doing nothing but waiting.I would be moving into that condo this fall, living a posh urban lifestyle, eating at trendy ethic restaurants, working in the city, and going out dancing each weekend with my friends.

Instead, I decided to give my bouquet away to the next couple to get married.  I was happy to announce that we had two newly engaged couples at our wedding, so I gave each of them a bouquet.  It was handy that my bridesmaids and I all had identical flowers!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/wedding%20items/johnannie.JPG\\\">I also gave a bouquet to my aunt and uncle, who were celebrating their 40th anniversary at our wedding.

What a beautiful day for an outdoor adventure!<!--more Pictures of our aspen hunt--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Wilkerson%20Pass/aspenhunt01.JPG\\\">We began the day on a hike at Waldo Canyon, near our home in Manitou Springs.  The first parts of the trail follow Hwy 24.  This picture makes me smile, because it reminds me of some of the aspects of the DC area that I do NOT miss.  This road is the highway nearest our house.  As we walked along the trail, I couldn\\\'t help but compare it to all the times I used to rollerblade along Northern Virginia\\\'s W&OD trail, which follows Interstate 66, and all its traffic, exhaust, and power lines.  Aahhhh, you can almost smell the fresh air in this picture.After walking about a mile on this trail, we were disappointed in its complete lack of Aspen trees.

Neither of us had ever been there, but we figured that it\\\'s one of the Colorado destinations that every resident must see.  As we descended into Aspen valley, we were overwhelmed by golden fields of vivid autumn aspen trees, apparently a fitting namesake for the city.<!--more Photos of the aspens in their October glory--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen4.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen6.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen10.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen5.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen18.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen17.jpg\\\">By the time we arrived in the lovely town of Aspen, the sun was setting.  We were four hours from home, and didn\\\'t want to drive back over Independence pass in the darkness.  Suddenly we were in need of a place to stay for the night.  The problem is that we had no tent, no camping gear, and a dog.  Hotels aren\\\'t often so fond of dogs.  I love our spontaneous spirit of adventure, but sometimes we should bring more stuff.We found a handy book called <i>Canine Colorado</i>, which listed the handful of dog-friendly hotels in the Aspen area.  After many unsuccessful phone calls, we found a ski resort hotel with availability for the three of us for the night.  It was located in Snowmass Village, which we didn\\\'t realize was not the same thing as the town of Snowmass.A few hours later, we found ourselves dreadfully lost in the darkness, on a dirt road outside of the tiny village (and decidedly non-ski resort) of Snowmass.  We figured out that we needed to be heading southwest to get to Snowmass Village, so we suspected that we were at least going the right direction.  Our narrow, one-lane dirt road gradually climbed uphill.  Suddenly the road got bumpier, and the gradual incline turned into a nerve-wreckingly steep hill.  We were getting a little scared by this point.  It didn\\\'t help that some animal that resembled a baby bear waddled in front of the car.  Where the heck were we, and were we going to get eaten by some horrible wilderness monster?Then we saw a metal tower rising above the road, in this otherwise deserted forest.  As we got closer, we saw two seats dangling from it.  Ski lifts!  We drove under the ski lift, and then through a wide clearing in the forest.Holy crap, we were driving up the ski slopes!  The dirt path curved sharply up the hill, and we followed it, not knowing what else to do.  I burst out laughing from the insanity of it all, while Mike was getting antsy.  What was going to happen when we got to the top of the slopes?  We had no clue.We made it to the top of the mountain, and found a paved road up there!  We had no idea where it would lead, but it was paved, so we followed it.  The road led us down the other side of the mountain.  At the bottom of the mountain, we were greeted by signs for the Snowmass Village.  We had arrived!  We found our hotel within minutes, and had a huge laugh.  Imagine, we drove up the ski slope, and down the other side of the mountain to get there.  In complete darkness.  We are maniacs.  We slept in a comfy hotel room last night, and then went for a lovely hike along Hunter Creek today.  What a fun and bizarre weekend.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen14.jpg\\\">We woke up this morning to gorgeous views outside the hotel windows.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen13.jpg\\\">I love our idea of \\\"camping.\\\"<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/aspen20.jpg\\\">We left Snowmass Village, and drove back to Aspen.

Mike and I had a wonderful weekend in St. Louis, where they celebrated their wedding under clear blue skies and in the company of loving friends and family.  Their story is so sweet!  Chris and Mina were childhood playmates in the Philippines.  Chris and his family later moved to the US, where he still lives today.  Years later, he and Mina reunited and discovered that they were a perfect match.  They have spent their relationship separated across thousands of miles, waiting for the day that they would be together.  This wedding marks the end of their separation, and the beginning of a beautiful marriage.  I\\\'ll post more pictures in a few weeks, after I\\\'ve had a chance to sort through them.  In the meanwhile, here\\\'s a few preview photos.  Mina and Chris, Mike and I hope you are having a wonderful time in Hawaii!

As you may recall from my last post, our car was totalled when someone drove into us in Dallas last week.  My parents offered to drive Mike and me back to Colorado, even though they live in Virginia.  For those who aren\\\'t familiar with US geography, Colorado is nowhere near Virginia.  My parents are saints.On Sunday, we had the brilliant idea to avoid a possible snowstorm by driving the Colorado backroads instead of the New Mexico interstate.  Now guess where the snowstorm decided to hit.  I\\\'ll give you a hint... it wasn\\\'t New Mexico.The snow fell in huge chunks, and the roads were terrible.  Winds approached 60mph.  There was no visibility from all the snow blowing horizontally.  It was whiteout everywhere.  We made it to the tiny, one-truck-stop town of Springfield, CO, and learned that all the roads out of the town were closed.  We were stuck.  We were really lucky to book one of the last available motel rooms in town.  We got in the room at 2pm, and had to occupy ourselves until we got back on the roads at 6:45am the next day.  There was a restaurant one block away, so we joined dozens of other stranded holiday travelers for burgers and chili.  The meal was pleasant, but walking back to the motel was dreadful.  We had to walk into the wind, and that icy snow struck our faces like thousands of pins and needles.  I could barely breathe.  We got up early this morning and got Mike to work by eleven.  I tell ya, that guy can\\\'t get a break.  In the last seven days, he has been sick with the flu, got in a car accident, suffered an eye and head injury, went to the hospital, had to socialize with a dozen in-laws while aching and semi-blind, and then got stranded in a blizzard.  And after all that, he actually got in trouble for being late to work. Oh well, we\\\'re home safely.  My car is still in Texas, but the rest of us are doing just fine.<!--more Here are some pictures from our snowbound motel--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/11_27_Snowbound/mom_snow.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2005/11_27_Snowbound/dad_RescuetheSodas.jpg\\\">Dad went back out in the snow to rescue my mother\\\'s Diet Dr. Peppers.

His vision is still blurry in his left eye, but it seems to be getting better.  He has another appointment with an eye doctor tomorrow, so we\\\'ll find out more then.  My car is totalled, but the accident wasn\\\'t my fault, so hopefully we\\\'ll get some money from the other driver\\\'s insurance company.  That process is just beginning.  In the meanwhile, I don\\\'t have a car.  Oh joy.  I\\\'ve been an anxious driver over the last few days.  I find myself particularly nervous about air bags.

Just not as frequently as I expected.  ;-)Here is some more <a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/MVI_2712.AVI\\\">VIDEO</a>, this time with Mike\\\'s eloquent description of the process of learning snowboarding.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/darrenmike_lift.jpg\\\">After only a few runs down the bunny trail, he decided to try a lift for the first time.  Here he is with our friend, Darren, who is a great snowboarder and helped Mike learn the ropes yesterday.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/howardcharlotte.jpg\\\">Here I am with Howard.

He\\\'s a natural!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/howard.jpg\\\">We escorted Mike down this beginner slope several times.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/howard_christopher.jpg\\\">Here\\\'s Howard with Christopher, his little froggy ski buddy.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/mike_greenslope.jpg\\\">After lunch, Mike was ready to try a real green slope!  We took the lift up to the top!  He was amazing.  He was cruising down the hills with no fear at all.  There were times when I thought that he was a better in one day of snowboarding than I was in 21 years of skiing.  (But then I really do suck at skiing, so that\\\'s not saying much.)  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/01-22-Vail/charmike.jpg\\\">Sometimes I have to pinch myself to think that we really live here in Colorado.

I hope you enjoy the pictures as I relive the greatest weeks of my life!<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/airplane.jpg\\\"></p>As you may recall, we got married in England.  This was the view out our window as we arrived.  Note the lush green fields that mark the landscape of the countryside where Mike grew up.  The sun was shining, and the weather was perfect that morning.  It was really going to happen... this was really the flight that would lead to our wedding.  The next time we\\\'d see the English countryside from this view, we\\\'d be husband and wife.<!--more But let\\\'s start at the very beginning--><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/MikeConnie_textmsg.jpg\\\">A week and a half before our wedding day, Mike and I flew from Colorado to DC to meet my parents.  I love this picture of Mike and my mother instant messaging each other outside Reagan airport.  Tech geekiness runs in my family.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/ConnieGayleChar_luggage.jpg\\\">The next day, my parents, my aunt Gayle, Mike, and I all headed to Dulles airport to begin our trip to the UK.  This picture doesn\\\'t do a great job of showing just how obscene our luggage was.  There were stacks of suitcases standing behind the ones you see here.  It is a big task to plan a wedding overseas!  We had already mailed lots of wedding items to Mike\\\'s parents, such as favors, programs, and decorations, but we still had plenty of other things to bring with us.In this picture I am holding the crate that we named \\\"The Coffin.\\\"  This plastic container held my wedding gown and veil.  It was the source of lots of humor throughout our travels.  Just minutes after this picture was taken, I got bridal on the Virgin Atlantic security staff.  They labeled me a security risk, and covered The Coffin with big labels that said, \\\"Do not load.\\\"  They weren\\\'t going to put my gown on the plane!  I freaked.  Then they told me that Mike and I didn\\\'t have tickets for the flight.  I continued to freak.  Tears came out.  At the time it sucked, but in retrospect, the whole situation was hilarious.  I wrote a big post about it <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.livejournal.com/37852.html\\\">HERE</a>.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/LondonAmbulances.jpg\\\">By some stroke of mercy, the Virgin Atlantic people let me (and the gown) on the plane, and we arrived safely in London the following morning.  We arrived just a few weeks after last July\\\'s terrorist bombings in London, and security was high throughout the city.  I had never seen so many heavily-armed police officers in the UK.  I took this picture near Buckingham Palace.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/Hotelisonfire.jpg\\\">One evening while we were in London, Mike and I went out to a pub with his brother and his girlfriend.  While we were gone, just because the gods were trying to prevent my gown from arriving safely at our wedding, the hotel caught on fire!  My mother took this picture of the evacuated hotel.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/Dad_rescuingthedress.jpg\\\">My dad, being the saint that he is, rescued my gown from the hotel when they had to evacuate.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/groupshot2.jpg\\\">Fortunately the hotel was fine (I think it was a kitchen fire).  The next day, Mike headed off for a weekend bachelor party extravaganza.  Here he is with several of his friends, drinking beer and playing soccer.  The guys rented a soccer field at Wembley Stadium, and they played a huge match all afternoon.  What a great idea!  Mike is in the back row, third guy from the left.  Note that they made him wear a pink shirt.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/mike_chav.jpg\\\">The pink shirt-wearing continued after the game.  In the evening, they all went out on the town for some god-knows-what, and they made Mike dress in a pink shirt, capri pants, and a Burberry cap.  I love it.  Bwahahaha.  Mike had a fantastic time, and he only fell out of a double-decker bus once that night.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/CharGayle_watchingthemloadthecar.jpg\\\">We gave Mike a full day to recover from his, um, dehydration.  On Monday morning, we packed up our rental van and got ready to head west to Mike\\\'s hometown.  My aunt Gayle and I leisurely (ok, lazily) sipped our lattes as my dad and Mike packed the car.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/1%20London/BillMike_loadingthecar.jpg\\\">They filled up the van, from top to bottom!  The only problem was that there wasn\\\'t enough room for the bride and groom.  Oops.  So Mike and I decided to take a train and meet them in Bristol.  Unfortunately there was a bomb threat on the Tube while we were traveling to Paddington Station.  We had to get off the train and walk to another station.  We got terribly lost.  We ended up walking several miles all over town, finally wandering through Notting Hill to the train station.  By the time we got to Mike\\\'s home town of Wells, my family had already been drinking at a pub for hours.The next post: Our week in Wells!','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:24','2006-01-26 18:10:00','Our wedding story, part 1: Weekend in London','our-wedding-story-part-1-weekend-in-london.html','/2006/1/26/',1),

We arrived in Mike\\\'s hometown of Wells, England on a Monday, and the wedding took place the following Saturday. Most of our American visitors stayed at the Swan Hotel, which was also the location of the wedding ceremony and reception.  The hotel sits in the center of town, directly across the street from a cathedral that dates back to the 1200s.  A block away is the Bishop\\\'s Palace, a medieval castle with a moat.  One of my favorite parts of the entire wedding experience was sharing this town with my friends and family.  It was absolutly fantastic to be able to wander into a pub in town and find a table full of my relatives or college roommates.  Just about anywhere I looked, someone I loved was nearby.  During the days, guests would explore nearby cities and villages, and in the evenings we would eat dinner together in pubs and laugh for hours.  <!--more Pictures from our week before the wedding-->NOTE: Throughout the course of this wedding story, most of the photos that I post are not my own. I was very busy with other things, as you might imagine, so most of the pictures are taken by friends, family, or professionals.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/MakingWelcomeBags.jpg\\\">During the first few days we were in town, most of the guests hadn\\\'t arrived yet, so we used this time to prepare place cards, favors, and welcome baskets.  In this picture, my mother, Mike, and I are filled gift bags with chips, chocolate, water bottles, stamped postcards, tourist information, and a schedule of events.  We put a welcome bag in each hotel room on the mornings that guests arrived.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Char_welcomebags.jpg\\\">I decorated the bags with a photo of the Wells cathedral and a message that said \\\"Welcome to Wells!\\\"  This little room was the room where I stayed during the week.  On the night before the wedding, I transferred to the four-poster bridal suite next door.  The view outside the windows of both rooms was the gorgeous cathedral across the street.  Every morning I woke up to the sound of the church bells.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Connie_makingplacecards.jpg\\\">My mother helped prepare the placecards that my friends Heather and Judy made for me.  They were so beautiful!  Each place card was a fabric flower that they had sewn, with a pearl bead in the middle.  I printed each guest\\\'s name and table number on cardstock and cut them into leaf shapes.  My mother sewed each leaf onto a flower.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Gayle_fillingfavors.jpg\\\">My aunt Gayle filled the favor boxes that I had made.  Each box had two pieces of British chocolate, two pieces of American chocolate, and a note that said, \\\"A taste of home from each of us.\\\"  We sealed each box with a lapel pin of the US and UK flags.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/JimEvelyn_Bishopspalace.jpg\\\">Our guests started arriving mid-week!  Here are my uncle Jim and aunt Eveyln on the drawbridge at the Bishop\\\'s Palace.  They flew in all the way from their small town in Montana.  It was Evelyn\\\'s first time out of the country!  She loved England!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Mary_glastonbury.jpg\\\">Here is my cousin, Mary, at the Glastonbury Abbey.  She traveled in from Texas with her parents, Annie and John.  My aunt Bitsy traveled with her college roommate, Margaret.  I\\\'m sorry that I don\\\'t have pictures of everyone from the days before the wedding.  I am relying almost exclusively on pictures that my family and friends took during that week.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/MaryAnnMelanie.jpg\\\">Here is my friend, Melanie, with her mother, Mary Ann.  Melanie and I were in the color guard together back in high school.  I\\\'ve been friends with her for years!  Her mother traveled all the way from California to be at the wedding, making her the guest who had traveled the furthest.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/RomanBathsInBath2.jpg\\\">My sister-in-law (and bridesmaid!), Molly, along with my brother, Paul, and their two kids, arrived mid-week.  Here are Molly, Robby, and Kenna at the ancient Roman Baths in the city of Bath.  Little Kenna is such a cute big sister!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Bath_BillPaulRobby.jpg\\\">My dad, brother, and nephew at the Roman Baths.

Here are Heather and Sarah helping me to carry my dress from the dry cleaners back to the hotel after it was pressed.  It was funny to walk several blocks along the main street carrying this huge dress.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Sarah_stairs.jpg\\\">On the Friday afternoon before the wedding, Mike and I showed Sarah and Heather and their husbands around the town.  I love this picture of Sarah climbing into the back rooms of the cathedral.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/CharliesAngels.jpg\\\">We played around in a medieval, Lord-of-the-Ring-esque, meeting room in the back of the cathedral.  Of course, when you get three girls and a camera together, this picture is bound to happen.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/CharliesAngels_laugh.jpg\\\">I love my friends!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Charandfriends.jpg\\\">I love this picture Mike took of Scott, Heather, me, Sarah, and Marc, in the archway leading from the palace to the market square. <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/CharMike_cathedralgreen.jpg\\\">Oh my god, Mike, this time tomorrow we\\\'ll be getting married!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/MyFriendsInPup.jpg\\\">Mike took us to his favorite pub in town, and we shared a pre-rehearsal dinner pint.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Matthew_cricket.jpg\\\">I had to leave the pub early to take care of some more pre-wedding planning details.  I got distracted, though, because some of my friends and relatives playing cricket on the cathedral green!  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/Char_cricket.jpg\\\">Of course I had to try my hand at cricket.  It wasn\\\'t pretty.  When I walked back into our hotel lobby across the street, three hotel staff members were watching the Americans playing cricket and laughing at us.  Then, right there in the hotel lobby, the three ladies taught me how to swing a bat and step into the swing.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/BridesmaidsLaugh.jpg\\\">Late Friday afternoon, Kathy was the last of my bridesmaids to arrive.  Of course I had to take the girls to my bridal suite to show off my fabulous gown.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/2%20Week%20in%20Wells/ViewFromMyWindow2.jpg\\\">Finally it was time for me to get ready for the rehearsal dinner.  The first of our official wedding celebrations was about to begin.  I looked out my hotel window as the setting sun illuminated the dark blue clouds.

The very next day I\\\'d finally get to wear that dress! The whole thing seemed surreal to me.  Was I really about to go to a rehearsal dinner where I was the bride?  Was that bridal gown really going to be worn by me?  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/3%20Rehearsal/walkingtodinner.jpg\\\">All my American family and friends met in the hotel lobby, and then we all walked the two blocks to the restaurant.

Now it is a lovely restaurant upstairs, and a pub with a garden downstairs.  The entire top floor of the restaurant was reserved for our party.  The tables had been lined up in two long rows, with Mike and me seated at a head table in between.  The layout was actually pretty awkard, though, because my friends and family all sat on one side, and Mike\\\'s guests sat on the other.  There was very little intermingling, unfortunately.  But at least it gave the guests a chance to meet each other in small doses.  The next day they were ready for more intermingling!The top table was decorated with streamers, confetti, and a balloon.  My little niece immediately assumed the balloon was for her, so she took care of it for the rest of the weekend.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/3%20Rehearsal/Dinner_BillConnieChar.jpg\\\">My parents were having so much fun!

Meanwhile, a big group of my family and friends hanged out in the hotel lobby throughout the evening.  We just chatted, laughed, and had a great time for hours.  I couldn\\\'t believe that my college friends from Virginia were socializing with my aunts from Texas, and my high school buddies were bonding with my cousin.  It was too wonderful to be real.  I wish there were more opportunities in my life to have all my favorite people in one room.Back row: My cousin Mary, Uncle John, Mom, Kathy, Melanie, Aunt Annie, DadFront row: Sarah, Me, Heather, ScottAt midnight, we rang in the start of the wedding day.

The church bells began to ring eleven times.  Paul stopped mid-sentence, closed his eyes, and looked up toward the ceiling.  He said he had always imagined the sound of the church bells ringing at the start of his wedding ceremony.  That time had come.Six years later, I woke up on a Saturday morning to the sound of cathedral bells.  My time had come.<!--more Photos of the morning of our wedding day-->I can\\\'t remember whether I lay in bed for a while, enjoying the moment, or whether I leapt out of bed with excitement.  It\\\'s funny how these details can vanish from memory in only six months.  I\\\'m glad I\\\'m writing them down before I forget too much.  I do know that I woke up earlier than I had hoped that morning, especially after having been up so late the night before.  I was just too excited to sleep.After spending the previous evening surrounded by family and friends, it was strange to wake up in that big hotel room all alone.  I guess I had imagined some kind of fanfare to greet me on the morning of my wedding, but of course there wasn\\\'t.  I just got up and brushed my teeth, just like any other morning.  I didn\\\'t feel like a bride, however that is supposed to feel.  I don\\\'t know why that was surprising to me, but it was.  Did any of you feel that way on your wedding morning?<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Breakfast_KathyPaulChar.jpg\\\">I went downstairs to the breakfast room, and many of my family and friends were already there.  Here I am with my friend Kathy and brother Paul.  I loved the breakfasts that we had that week in the hotel--it was just so cool to wake up each morning, come downstairs, and find my relatives sharing a meal with my friends.  I\\\'d see my mom\\\'s brother eating with my dad\\\'s sister or my college roommate.  Surreal, but wonderful.Mike stayed at his parents\\\' house all week, and I wasn\\\'t going to see him until 3:00, an hour and a half before the wedding.I think photo credit goes to my mother and Molly for this batch of pictures.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Breakfast_Mom.jpg\\\">The mother of the bride was there, with camera in hand and looking radiant.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/sign.jpg\\\">They told me that a sign had gone up overnight to announce our wedding at the hotel.  It was weird to see our names up there on the wall.  Everything seemed so official... like it was all happening around us, without us.  We hadn\\\'t put our names on that wall; they just appeared there when we weren\\\'t looking.  July 30th had arrived on its own, even though I didn\\\'t feel like a bride yet.  Reality started to spin around me.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_CharKennaTwirl.jpg\\\">Kenna was feeling energetic and looking adorable, so I decided to stop thinking about the wedding and focus on her instead.  Look!  She was carrying around the purse I had given her the night before!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_KennaBalloons.jpg\\\">She was also still carrying around the balloons from the night before.  Too funny.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_MollyPaulKenna.jpg\\\">Poor Molly never seems to get in the photos unless she takes them herself!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_RobbyBill.jpg\\\">We all spent some time on the hotel patio, enjoying each other\\\'s company and relaxing before the big events started.  My dad is such a cute grandpa.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_CharHat.jpg\\\">My mother had brought a hat to wear at the reception, as is customary at many traditional English weddings.  Here I am, trying to look prim and proper.  I can\\\'t really pull that off.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_Jim.jpg\\\">I really like this picture of my Uncle Jim, my mom\\\'s brother.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/SwanPatio_GwynneMatthew2.jpg\\\">All our early-morning commotion out on the patio woke up many of the hotel guests, including Matthew and Gwynne.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Cafe_EddieKathyChar.jpg\\\">It was probably best that we leave the hotel and take our energy elsewhere.  Kathy, her boyfriend Eddie, my mother, and I all went around the block for some coffee.  I was on a mission for my perfect Wedding Day Vanilla Latte.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Cafe_CharCoffe.jpg\\\">What I was served instead was powdered instant coffee in a mug that said \\\"Great All American Coffee.\\\"  Um, has that company even BEEN to America?  Surely they have at least encountered a Starbucks or two.  That coffee was neither great nor American, and it certainly wasn\\\'t worthy of the title of Wedding Day Vanilla Latte. <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Cafe_CharKathy.jpg\\\">Everything seemed funny to us.  I was just full of so much energy that I didn\\\'t know how to contain.  Finally we left, because I really needed that latte.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/4%20Morning/Cafe_CharLatte.jpg\\\">Finally I found one a couple doors down from our hotel.  I was content.

Suddenly it feels real.<!--more Watch as Mike and I get ready for the wedding-->NOTE: This is when the photo selection process gets difficult!  I have 800 wonderful pictures from our professional photographers, Jenni and Colin of <a href=\\\"http://www.photojennic.co.uk\\\">Photojennic</a>, and lots of pictures from friends and family, too.  I hope Jenni doesn\\\'t mind that I mix them up for the sake of storytelling.  Thanks again to everyone who took pictures throughout the wedding day!  These pictures mean so much to me.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/KathyChampagne.jpg\\\">At noon on the wedding day, my friends, my mom, and I all walked to the salon around the corner from the hotel.  Everything in the whole weekend weekend was within a few blocks of the hotel.  We brought champagne and orange juice, and Kathy did the honors.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/007.jpg\\\">I love this photo of my mom with my friend Melanie.  I didn\\\'t know it at the time, but apparently shortly after Mel left the salon, she was running all over town, saving the day.  The florist hadn\\\'t brought pins for the guy\\\'s flowers, and the DJ hadn\\\'t brought music for the ceremony.  Melanie found both, and I owe her lots of credit for the rest of the day running smoothly.  Thanks SO much, Melanie!My parents also worked really hard during those hours before the wedding!  My mom kept running back and forth from the salon to the hotel and back, making sure that the flowers and cake had arrived, and helping Melanie with the other errands.  My dad went into every hotel in town, trying to find a groomsman who hadn\\\'t arrived yet.  To be honest, I\\\'m not sure exactly what they all had to do during that time, because everyone tried hard to keep me blissfully unaware.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/salondance.jpg\\\">It worked.  While they were working hard to make the wedding happen, I was drinking mimosas and dancing to the music on the salon\\\'s loudspeaker.  Those of you who don\\\'t go to many weddings might be surprised to hear how many brides cry at the salon.  That time in the hairstylist\\\'s chair is often the first time a bride has sat still for days.  Suddenly she has time to think, and the pressure and enormity of the day overwhelms her.  I wondered if I would end up crying, too.  Nope.  I danced.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/Salon_HeatherKathy.jpg\\\">Heather and Sarah had their hair done at the salon, too. Kathy came to keep us company and drink with us.  It was fun!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/Salon_SarahHair.jpg\\\">Sarah, before and after!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/013.jpg\\\">When I sat down with the makeup artist, the photographer and videographer arrived.  Wow, that was weird.  I\\\'m not used to being on that side of a camera at a wedding.  Don\\\'t get me wrong... I loved it!  But it was definitely weird.  At one point while I was sitting in the makeup chair, the videographer zoomed up on my face and asked me how I was feeling.  I was flustered and said something stupid like, \\\"This is really weird.  When I put on my veil, I\\\'m really going to freak out.\\\"  Smooth move, Charlotte.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/Gown_room.jpg\\\">After our hair and makeup was finished, we hurried back to the hotel.  I got dressed in my four-poster bridal suite, with a view of the cathedral out the window.  My gown was from Lazaro.  It was a gorgeous silk gown with lots of lace along the trim.  You can see a picture from the Lazaro website <a href=\\\"http://www.lazarobridal.com/laz_b/display_dress.php?imageno=3643&multimatch=x\\\">HERE</a>.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/031.jpg\\\">Our flowers arrived!  I chose a color scheme of blues, purples, and pinks, and I let the florist decide which flowers to use.  I loved the results!  They were gorgeous!  The bridesmaids and I all carried identical bouquets.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/023.jpg\\\">Kenna carried a pomander of flowers that matched ours.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/kenna.jpg\\\">Kenna was looking absolutely adorable, coming and going.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/ringpillow.jpg\\\">Our rings were tied and ready for Matthew to carry them down the aisle.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/044.jpg\\\">It was time to put on the dress!  Do I look excited or what?  I had been looking forward to this moment for so long.  When I had woken up that morning, I was seriously tempted to put on the dress and wear it to breakfast.  I wanted to wear it for every minute that I could!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/056.jpg\\\">The girls helped me get dressed, and Jenni was there, taking gorgeous photos.  That stunning mantilla veil belongs to Sarah, and it\\\'s the most beautiful veil I have ever seen.  She offered to let me wear it because it coordinated so beautifully with my gown.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/069.jpg\\\">Meanwhile, Mike was down the street, feeling disoriented.  Look at the expression on his face!  All the guys met at his favorite pub, including his childhood friends, his college friends, my friends\\\' husbands, his relatives, and my relatives.  I just love how everyone bonded so quickly.  Poor Mike was overwhelmed, though!In this picture, the best man, Howard, is leading a toast.  As I type this memoir, in January 2006, Mike and Howard are spending a week together in Vail.  It\\\'s such a treasure to have friendships that can bridge time and distance.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/073.jpg\\\">I love this picture of Mike and Howard trying to figure out how to tie their ties.  All the suits for the groomsmen and fathers had clip-on ties, but the groom and best man had real ties.  They had to be tied in some ruffly way that was completely unfamiliar to them.  That\\\'s ok, because they both ended up taking the ties off as soon as they could after the ceremony!<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/ParentsSeeMe.jpg\\\">Back at the hotel, the bridesmaids and I had finished dressing.  My parents had been getting ready in their own room.  These two wonderful pictures show the moments that each of my parents saw me dressed up for the first time.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/085.jpg\\\">My only disappointment about our gorgeous professional pictures is that there aren\\\'t many of Mike\\\'s mother.  This isn\\\'t a flattering photo, but it\\\'s one of the few we have of Mike and his mum.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/127.jpg\\\">I love this photo of Mike with both of our dads.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/5%20Preparations/091.jpg\\\">It was time to go.  I was finally going to see Mike as my groom.  He would see me as his bride.

When I peeked through the doorway, I was struck by how gorgeous he looked. That lovely man in the tux was about to become my husband. I wondered for a brief second whether he thought I looked nice, and then he said, \\\"WOW.\\\" I hurried over to Mike and held onto him.I was finally in the arms of the person I turn to in times of joy and stress. Suddenly my pre-wedding anxiety washed away. Everything was exactly how it should be.<!--more Next was a fun portrait session with Mike and the wedding party-->NOTE: All of these beautiful photos are presented courtesy of our photographers, Jenni and Colin of Photojennic.  <img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/149.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/161.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/156.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/236.jpg\\\">Mike and I got engaged a few weeks after we had lost our jobs in 2004.  We didn\\\'t have much money, and what money we did have we wanted to save for our upcoming move to Colorado.  We decided not to buy an engagement ring.  When we told his parents about this decision, his mother handed me this gold ring with sapphires and diamonds.  Mike\\\'s father had given it to her 30 years earlier, and she had worn it every day since.  Mike remembers this ring being on his mother\\\'s hand throughout his childhood.  She gave it to me that day, and I accepted it with emotional gratitude.  I wear it every day on my right hand, as a symbol of my acceptance in his wonderful family.<img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/203.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/mikeandcharlotte/weddingphotos/Online%20wedding%20story/6%20Portraits/pomander.jpg\\\">As we were taking portraits, Kenna wandered onto the patio and gave her flowers to Mike.

That look on his face says it all.  When this picture was taken, I was waiting with my bridesmaids on the other side of the wall, looking just as scared.  At least I had some privacy back there. Poor Mike had to stand in front of all our guests and try to maintain his composure.  I don\\\'t know if I could have done it.  Even with years of attending weddings, I could never have predicted how it would feel to stand behind those doors, waiting to walk down the aisle.  Those few minutes were by far the most intense and even frightening parts of the entire wedding experience.  I don\\\'t know why I was so scared, but it was almost more than I could bear.  Part of me wanted the ceremony to hurry up and be over, so this pressure could end.  Another part of me hoped it wouldn\\\'t end too soon, because this was going to be one of the most special moments of my life.

Some of Mike\\\'s friends from England, Andy and Darren, joined us.  It was amazing!  I had always been fascinated by the halfpipe competitions on TV, but nothing prepares you for the experience of a snowboarder soaring over your head like this.  We were even less prepared for the flying motorcycles that we watched later in the night.<!--more Photos from the Winter X Games--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/xgames07.jpg\\\">Andy and Mike, as we arrived at the event.

These snowmobiles transported the competitors back up the hill after each run.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/xgames05.jpg\\\">We climbed about 2/3 of the way up the left side of the superpipe.  I don\\\'t know why I was surprised to discover that the entire structure was made of snow.  Spectators stood on the walls of snow that formed the sides of the pipe.  It was a difficult climb up that snowy hill!  That\\\'s Mike, Andy, and Darren on the right, with looks of sheer awe.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Aspen/xgames10.jpg\\\">This guy just soared over our heads.

I don\\\'t think we could ever run out of fun things to do on a weekend.We learned some new vocabulary there, too, that we eagerly overused for the rest of the trip.  The X Games announcers were hilarious--always talking in crazy X-TREME lingo, with unnecessary overemphasis:\\\"The snowboard superpipe is about to start!

They got married yesterday at the Gateway Presbyterian Church, with its gorgeous mountain views, and then celebrated at the Wyndham Hotel.  You may remember their <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.livejournal.com/47022.html\\\">engagement portraits</a> from September.  I had been looking forward to their wedding ever since I met Chris and Andrea last year. They are two of the most fascinating people around--intelligent, adventurous, and full of great stories.

	(139,1,'Mike and I woke up early this morning to go to the immigration offices in Denver for our Green Card interview.  The whole application process has taken months, and has included a mountain of paperwork.  We\\\'ve had to prove legitimate marriage, financial eligibility, employment, home ownership, and a ton of other details.  It got tricky, because I need to earn a certain amount of money to qualify as his sponsor, and as a starving artist, I fall short.  Mike is the breadwinner in this family, so we hoped they\\\'d approve us based on his finances instead.  We were a little nervous about the whole thing!  Finally today was the decision day.The waiting room at the immigration office was full of other couples who were applying through marriage, too.  A large one-way mirror peered out at us all, presumably revealing the true natures of our relationships to the people behind the window.  I looked around and tried to figure out which couples in the room were legitimate.  Several couples were cuddling and smooching as they waited for their interview.  Suddenly I felt like we weren\\\'t being cutesy enough to look like a real marriage, and I got worried.  I looked up from my cell phone\\\'s web browser, and glanced at Mike sitting next to me, also surfing on his phone.  As much as I love him, I felt no desire to do anything but sit there and surf the web next to him.  It\\\'s just bizarre for couples to go to a government office at 8:30 in the morning and make out.  That is plain weird.  I wondered if the mysterious people behind the mirror saw Mike and me and thought, \\\"Now that is a real married couple.  Look how comfortable they are to be ignoring each other.\\\"  I grinned and went back to reading The Onion.Finally they called our names, and we went back for our interview.  The interview process was pretty painless, even though we didn\\\'t have all the bank statements and insurance documents they apparently needed.  Even in our huge stack of folders, we still didn\\\'t bring enough documents.  Mike also got my birthplace wrong in his interview, and he didn\\\'t know my mother\\\'s full name.  Oh well, the guy interviewing us said that it was perfectly clear to him that we are a real couple based on how we interact.  He said that when you\\\'ve been doing his job for years, you just know.  I was fascinated.  Out of psychological curiosity, I\\\'d love to be a fly on his wall for a day.Finally he opened Mike\\\'s passport, stamped it, and it was over.  Mike got his green card!  Whew!  The official card will come in the mail in a month or two, but as of today, Mike is a legal permanent resident.  It is a great feeling!

The carillon structure isn\\\'t particularly interesting in itself; it is a rectangular metal tower that is often overlooked.  What makes this site so special is the music of the bells inside the tower.  During weekend afternoons in the summer, the Netherlands Carillon offers free, two-hour bell concerts with a variety of music.  The carillon sits in a large field, surrounded by flower gardens, and looking out across the Potomac to a gorgeous view of the monuments.When I lived in Arlington, I used to walk to the Carillon with a book, a blanket, and a picnic lunch or dinner.  I\\\'d sit and look out at the DC skyline, listen to the music, and wonder if it was for real.Usually the bell concerts are computerized, but it is still a great way to enjoy a picnic.  My favorite concerts, though, are the ones that are performed live, by musicians who ring the bells with a piano-like instrument.  You can climb the tower and watch the musicians inside, and then look out with a birds-eye view of the city.  Fantastic.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:26','2006-05-27 19:37:00','Summer in the city','summer-in-the-city.html','/2006/5/27/',1),

My friend and fellow photographer, Catherine Hopkinson, married Ryan in a picture-perfect wedding on Saturday.  I met Catherine a couple months ago at a bridal fair, and instantly liked her cheerful, energetic personality.  It turned out that my friend Steve Tinetti was shooting her wedding, and I was thrilled when he invited me to second shoot for him.  Steve was so much fun to work with, and Catherine and Ryan were fantastic to photograph.  I loved being a second shooter, because it gave me the freedom to capture some of the moments I\\\'d ordinarily miss.  We ended up with some gorgeous photographs!  Steve offered to let me post some of his portraits of Ryan and Catherine.  I love these photos!  I also have lots of my own pictures from the wedding behind the link. Catherine and Ryan, we hope you love the pictures!  Cathy, thanks for trusting us with your own wedding pictures--I know how strange it is to be the bride instead of the photographer.  :)<!--more More photos from Steve and me--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/steve1.jpg\\\">Photo by Steve Tinetti<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/steve3.jpg\\\">Photo by Steve TinettiAnd here is the wedding day through my eyes:<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/CatherineRyan01.jpg\\\">At the salon<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/CatherineRyan02.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/CatherineRyan03.jpg\\\">When Catherine and her friends arrived at the church, Ryan and the guys were across the street having their pictures taken.

I spent a week and a half in Virginia, visiting my parents and my brother and his family.  I went kayaking with my friend Sarah in western Virginia.  I went to my cousin Christine\\\'s baby shower in Maryland.  I caught up with friends I hadn\\\'t seen in ages.  Best of all, I got in lots of playtime with my niece and nephew.This week I came back to Colorado, just in time for a family reunion in Estes Park.  My aunt, uncle, cousins, and cousins\\\' children rented a house with a phenomenal view of Rocky Mountain National Park.  They all live far away from me (Indiana, New York, and Texas), so I was thrilled that they chose my state for their vacation!  It was great to be able to visit them in my own neck of the woods, and such a gorgeous location, too.  This morning we woke up early to take family portraits in the park, at a perfect spot along a winding creek.  The photo above was the view from the house patio last night.Now I am getting all caught up with my work, so I won\\\'t have a chance to sort through all my family photos for another week or so.  I\\\'ll have a lot of family pictures to share eventually.Sunday is our first anniversary.

Mike and I are touched by all the support we have from our LJ friends.  We celebrated our first anniversary with a camping trip in the mountains.  We chose this gorgeous spot in a canyon near Gunnison, Colorado, and camped right next to the river.  Ally splashed in the rushing waters and bit the waves.  Mike made a fire, and I taught him how to make s\\\'mores.  Apparently that\\\'s an American thing.  The three of us slept in a tent, and listened to the sounds of the river and a gentle rainfall overhead.  This morning we drove to the lovely mountain town of Crested Butte, and found a dog-friendly coffee shop.  Then we headed north along a bumpy, rocky, county road toward the area known as the Maroon Bells.  This area is often called the most beautiful part of Colorado, and it didn\\\'t disappoint.  The fields were full of yellow and purple wildflowers, leading to the bases of aspen-covered mountains.  We explored lakes and waterfalls, and eagerly showed Ally the wonders of the wilderness.  It was an excellent weekend.  We adore Colorado.<!--more More photos from today--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary02.jpg\\\">Our camping spot in the canyon<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary03.jpg\\\">Ally and Mike, wandering through wildflowers<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary05.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary06.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary07.jpg\\\">Ally, quite possibly the happiest dog on earth<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary08.jpg\\\">It makes me so happy to see her enjoy herself like this.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary09.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary10.jpg\\\">Ally and Mike in our mountainmobile<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/travel/USA/Colorado/Crested%20Butte/anniversary11.jpg\\\">I don\\\'t remember the mountain looking this pink, but I didn\\\'t change the colors of the photo at all.

My adored, all-time favorite teacher, Mr. Campbell, came to visit us!  He just finished a masters degree at Johns Hopkins, and he\\\'s driving home to San Diego, so he came through Colorado Springs to visit.  I hadn\\\'t seen him in years, so it was great to have him here.Mr. C is a gem of the educational system, and I am truly lucky to have been one of his students.  I was in his fifth grade class in Frankfurt, Germany, 22 years ago.  I realized even then that teachers with his passion, creativity, and humor don\\\'t come along often.  Our class was an experimental project that consisted of students in the gifted and talented program, and every day Mr. C found ways to expand our eager minds.  We included technology in ways that were rare in the mid-80s.  We learned about government by developing our own country, complete with a constitution, elected leaders, political campaigns, laws, and money.  We put on a play.  We went camping, and learned how to navigate the forest with a compass.  I still look back on that year as the most creatively and academically rewarding year of my life.When the year ended, the school did not continue our gifted and talented program into the sixth grade.  My classmates and I were divided into separate classrooms, and school was boring again.  I remember that my sixth grade teacher spent an entire month teaching the difference between positive numbers and negative numbers.  Some of my new classmates didn\\\'t understand, so none of us could advance until everyone was ready.  One day I was so bored that I completed all 70 pages of my math workbook.  I asked the teacher for something more advanced, but she wasn\\\'t able to provide it.Fortunately Mr. Campbell was still around, teaching the next year\\\'s fifth grade class.  Several of my friends felt just as unstimulated as I did, so we visited Mr. C for more inspiration.  That year he helped us to make a movie about our responses to the Cold War and nuclear threat.  Our movie was called \\\"The Day Before,\\\" and showed different kids\\\' possible responses to an imminent nuclear war.  It won a nationwide competition.  We all got back together the following year to make another movie.Mr. Campbell and I have kept in touch over all these years.   Ever since I was a kid, I have given him credit for my desire to help kids and pursue a career in education.  Now I have a masters degree in education, and I dream of teaching photography to kids.  Today I feel rejuvenated in that goal.<!--more More pictures, including our fifth grade class portrait!--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/portraits/Recent%20Portraits/Rick%20Campbell/campbell2.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/portraits/Recent%20Portraits/Rick%20Campbell/campbell3.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/portraits/Recent%20Portraits/Rick%20Campbell/fifthgradeclass.jpg\\\">Our fifth grade class.

Last Friday we flew to the east coast for a wedding, arriving in DC at about the same time as Ernesto, the tropical storm.  That was a fiercely bumpy landing!  Let\\\'s just say that I was squeezing poor Mike\\\'s hand so hard that I\\\'m surprised I didn\\\'t break anything.On Saturday we photographed a wedding at a gorgeous Maryland farm.  It rained all day, but the skies started to clear just minutes before the evening ceremony began.  I can\\\'t wait to post pictures.Sunday we spent the day on the Chesapeake Bay, at a cookout to say bon voyage to one of my best friends, Kathy.  Kathy is moving to Rome in a few days!  I can\\\'t believe she\\\'s really leaving, and I\\\'m a little sad about it.  By now I\\\'m used to having friends and family in different parts of the world, though, so I view her move as a perfect reason to go visit Italy a lot.  ;-)  We had a great going away party, at her father\\\'s amazing house that sits directly on the Bay.  We headed back to Colorado on Monday, bringing with us our brand new MacBook Pro (woo!).  I\\\'m not totally familiar with Mac yet, but so far I really like it.  Last weekend we also switched to shooting in RAW, so this week I\\\'m experimenting with RAW photo processing and a Mac workflow.  After I get all these technical details worked out, I\\\'ll post some pictures from Saturday\\\'s wedding and from the fun portrait shoot I did Tuesday with some adorable little girls.  Last night we went up to Denver to see Zero 7 in concert at the Gothic Theater.  They are one of Mike\\\'s favorite bands, but I\\\'m not very familiar with them, so I wasn\\\'t sure what to expect.  It was a great show!  I really enjoyed it!Now I\\\'m off to process some wedding pics.  But first, a latte.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:28','2006-09-07 16:37:00','Update','update.html','/2006/9/07/',1),

If you had a journal or blog then, please consider responding with an excerpt of your writings from that day.  <!--more My perspective that day--><b>Sep. 11th, 2001|10:17 am</b>I\\\'m terrified. Sirens have been rushing past my window all morning. With the sirens outside here in Arlington, and the explosions and smoke on the TV, I feel like I am in the middle of a war zone. I am so scared for all of my friends and family members who work in the govt buildings. I dread the news of all of the fatalities that have occurred.I\\\'m shaking... not sure whether to stay put, or to pack up the cats and get the hell out of here. My friend in Charlottesville said I should take the cats and go down there, and I\\\'m considering it. I\\\'m packing a bag of my negatives and other treasured possessions, and I have the cat carrier all ready, just in case I decide to go.<b>Sep. 11th, 2001|12:03 pm</b>We don\\\'t know if it\\\'s over. We don\\\'t know where or when there will be another attack. I don\\\'t know if I can feel safe where I am. I live 2 miles from the Pentagon, 1/2 mile from DC.I don\\\'t know whether I should stay put or get out of the DC area. The military is sending planes out of the DC area, ready to defend our country. I don\\\'t know what will happen next. This is a war, right here in my neighborhood.<b>Sep. 11th, 2001|04:20 pm</b>I am shocked, stunned, horrified. The financial district of New York City looks like Hiroshima. I can imagine the horror that people inside those buildings must have suffered. I only hope that the suffering didn\\\'t last long.The personal stories that will come out of these tragedies will be heartbreaking. This afternoon a man called NBC and described his escape from the 50th floor of building 1 of the World Trade Center. He sobbed as he described people in wheelchairs, hoping for someone to carry them down the stairs. What would you do in his situation? I don\\\'t even want to let myself think about what I would do. I cried as I thought not only about the terror of the people trapped in the buildings, but also the inevitable and pervasive guilt suffered by those who ran past them to save their own lives.I am aggravated by politicians\\\' reference to these terrorists as \\\"cowards.\\\" No, that word is not nearly powerful enough to label these loathesome beings. Evil, sub-human, perhaps, but our language can\\\'t support the concept very well.What great irony that the weather outside my window is so peaceful. Blue sunny skies all around. Except when I look in the distance of the Pentagon, where the sky is yellow.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:28','2006-09-11 18:31:00','September 11','september-11.html','/2006/9/11/',1),

Neither of us had been to Santa Fe before, and we loved it there.  Suzanne and Fred\\\'s wedding beautifully reflected the great culture, food, and history of the city.Suzanne and Fred have a fun story.  They have known each other ever since high school, but at the time, Fred was too shy to ask her out.  When they reunited 26 years later, Fred didn\\\'t let his second opportunity pass him by.  Now they are as giddy together as two teenagers in love.  They got married on Friday night, in the gorgeous Loretto Chapel in downtown Santa Fe.  Afterward they celebrated at an intimate dinner with close family and friends.  The following day, they had an enormous reception for hundreds of their friends, at a historic mission outside of the city.  Then on Sunday, Mike and I joined Suzanne and Fred for a fantastic post-wedding portrait shoot.As you can imagine, we have tons of great pictures from this three-day extravaganza.

Suzanne and Fred even wore cowboy boots!Here is part 2 of this three-day wedding celebration: Saturday.<!--more More of their family portraits and wedding reception--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_01.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_05.jpg\\\">Fred and his daughter<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_16.jpg\\\">Suzanne and her son and daughter<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_28.jpg\\\">In front of the chapel<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_29.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_13.jpg\\\">Inside the chapel<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_11.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_18.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_23.jpg\\\">Inside the old kitchen<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_21.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_25.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_09.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_30.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_34.jpg\\\">This enormous tree grew sideways.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_35.jpg\\\">In front of the morada, where men used to spend the 40 days of Lent as penance.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_37.jpg\\\">There were beautiful sights from every angle.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_39.jpg\\\">I love the lighting in this one.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_40.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_41.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_44.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_42.jpg\\\">They are so happy together!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_45.jpg\\\">I love this one of Suzanne dancing to make Fred smile for the camera.

They brought their beautiful red truck, and wanted to play a bit for the camera.  We loved it!

Our poor maple tree lost 6 huge branches!Yesterday we had a strange pre-winter storm, and accumulated around 6-7 inches.  We still have our summer hammock and patio umbrella out!  The leaves on our maple haven\\\'t even turned yellow yet, and they are now covered in snow!  Apparently the tree couldn\\\'t support the weight of all the leaves, as well as all this wet, heavy autumn snow.  Throughout the evening, Mike and I heard branches crashing down off the tree.  A huge limb fell onto the roof, and others fell on the fence, deck, and lawn.  Thank god there was no damage other than a slight dent in our gutter.  A tree this huge could really tear up our property.This morning it looked like a white, fluffy bomb had exploded all over our yard.

It\\\'s hard to believe that it takes two days of driving to travel just two states away!  Because we had weddings on both Saturdays that week, we had only six days to travel--two days of driving, two days in Culbertson, and then two days of driving again.  But it was worth it!We planned our visit for that week, because Mike\\\'s good friend, Richard, was visiting from England.  He drove from Minneapolis to Montana, and met us at this small town near the eastern border of the state.  Culbertson has only about 800 residents, and its nearest town is about 30 miles away.  My aunt and uncle live in the town, and own a farm nearby.  My mother grew up in this small town, and lived on this farm during the summers. The farm house still stands, but it is gradually falling down, which is sad to see.  We slept in a newer cabin near the original farm house.  At night we could hear coyotes all around, and look up to see crystal-clear stars and the Milky Way.  In the mornings, we\\\'d open the door to wide open spaces and blue skies.  It was fantastic to see my aunt, uncle, and cousins, and to meet the five children that my cousins adopted a few weeks ago.  My uncle gave me a tour of parts of the farm that I had never seen.  My aunt took us to the school where she works, which is the same school that my mother attended.  Mike, Richard, and I explored the farm by four-wheeler.  Ally sprinted through the fields, having the time of her life.<!--more More pictures from Montana--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/007.jpg\\\">Richard, having a blast on the four-wheeler<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/005.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/012.jpg\\\">Me, climbing on some of the old farm equipment that they have retired<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/014.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/023.jpg\\\">Mike and Ally<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/026.jpg\\\">Richard teaching me how to use that four-wheeler<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/033.jpg\\\">Brave Mike got on with me, despite my inability to steer or brake.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/037.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/040.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/043.jpg\\\">Ally wanted to ride on it, too<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/053.jpg\\\">Ally hurt her leg while trying to jump over a cattle grate, and Mike carried her all he way back to the cabin.

Ally, our troublemaker dog extraordinaire, probably considered this the best day of her life.We were driving around my uncle\\\'s farm, and parked several hundred yards from this herd of sheep.  Ally, who had never seen a sheep in her life, bolted out of the car like a bullet.  We had no idea what she was going to do when she reached the sheep.  Ally!  Come back!  Come here!  Bad girl!  She totally ignored us and sprinted toward the sheep.  Mike and I ran after her, not sure what to expect.Then I held my breath as she got to the herd.  Immediately she ran circles around them.  She was herding them!  She even retrieved one sheep that got separated from the herd. I was shocked.  How is it possible that this dog, who has no experience at all with sheep, knew exactly what she was supposed to do with them.  It was like a light bulb went off in her head, and she discovered her true reason for being.  Fascinating stuff.Of course the sheep weren\\\'t too thrilled with Ally\\\'s discovery.  Mike caught up with her and dragged her away.  Poor dog.<!--more More pictures of our shepherd-mix in action--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/129.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/130.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/132.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/133.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/10-10-Culbertson/135.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:29','2006-10-25 02:15:00','Ally herded sheep!','ally-herded-sheep.html','/2006/10/25/',1),

I\\\'m here all week for a wedding photography seminar called the Anti-Workshop.  It\\\'s a small, hands-on workshop taught by two of my favorite photography teams, <a href=\\\"http://www.boutwellstudio.com/\\\">Doug and Chenin Boutwell</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.altf.com/\\\">John and Dalisa Cooper</a>.  They are amazing!  Both husband-wife teams are rock stars in the wedding industry, known for their edgy photos and crazy concepts.  They decided to hold this workshop to encourage other photographers to step outside their predictable images, and aim for something different.  Austin has been the perfect setting for this seminar, with lots of great photo locations!  Today we worked in teams of four, with a model for each team.  We had two hours to wander around Austin for a photo scavenger hunt.  Loved it.  I especially loved seeing the outstanding images that other photographers came up with during this assignment.  Seriously I was blown away by the talent in that room.  Here are some of the ones that I took today.<!--more More photos from today--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/02.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/01.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/03.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/04.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/05.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/08.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/09.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/10.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/11.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/12.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/14.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/16.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/17.jpg\\\">One of the items on our scavenger hunt was a \\\"risky shot.\\\"<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/19.jpg\\\">This recycling center was our interpretation of a \\\"green location.\\\"<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/20.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/antiworkshop/21.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:30','2006-11-30 06:57:00','The Anti-Workshop','the-anti-workshop.html','/2006/11/30/',1),

My parents encouraged me to open their present early, and I\\\'m so glad I did.  Thanks, Mom and Dad!!  This Canon G7 is vastly superior to my old point-and-shoot.  That camera was four years old, and I\\\'ve been so disappointed with it that I didn\\\'t even carry it with me anymore.  I\\\'ve skipped out on lots of opportunities to take pictures of family, friends, and our daily lives, because it\\\'s just too much hassle to lug my big camera gear around.  This new point-and-shoot is great, and I hope to have it with me at all times now.  Here are some of its amazing features:-- 10 megapixels-- image stabilzer-- ISOs from 80-1600-- 6x optical zoom-- 1 cm macro (blew my mind)-- hot shoe for external flash-- face recognition with evaluative metering-- video (fun!)-- full automatic, semi-auto, and manual setting optionsThis morning I took the camera to a coffee get-together with some of my Denver photographer friends.  We had a lot of fun as always, and they seemed to enjoy my new camera as much as I do.   Hey, DWF gang, I\\\'ll see you at the next coffee club!

I love these books, and I\\\'d like to make enough beautiful samples to show my clients how great they are.  The idea is that couples use their engagement portraits in custom photobooks, which they display at their wedding reception.  Guests sign in the white spaces surrounding the photos.  Guests love looking through these books, and after the wedding, the couple is left with a beautiful photo book filled with greetings from their loved ones.

I brought my trusty little point-and-shoot, and got some great pictures with it.<!--more More beach sunset photos--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston004.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston005_crop.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston009.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston013_crop.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston018.JPG\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston023.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston022.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston028.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston031.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston030.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston040.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston045.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/events/2006/12-20-London/06-12-28-Weston050.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:31','2006-12-29 19:38:00','Weston-super-Mare','weston-super-mare.html','/2006/12/29/',1),

He has a wonderful artistic eye and a great compassion for people and their experiences, so his photography is beautiful.  <!--more Here are a few of my favorites of Mike\\\'s photography over the last year--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sun_25.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Penny%20and%20David/75.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Amy%20and%20Brad/23.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Mina%20and%20Chris/amargo06.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Gabrielle%20and%20Dylan/47.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Mina%20and%20Chris/amargo02.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Kim%20and%20Ken/kimken29.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Amanda%20and%20Brett/68.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Lynda%20and%20Dan/54.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Suzanne%20and%20Fred/sat_29.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Kim%20and%20John/068.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Mark%20and%20Jenny/127.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Gabrielle%20and%20Dylan/06.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Peggy%20and%20Joel/Ross023.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Penny%20and%20David/preview44.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Rebecca%20and%20Rodney/Keller17.JPG\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Mark%20and%20Jenny/593.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Vanessa%20and%20Robin/RobinVanessa54.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Andrea%20and%20Chris/brickey34a.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Amanda%20and%20Brett/21.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Penny%20and%20David/49.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Tina%20and%20Craig/baptiste23.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Amanda%20and%20Brett/63.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Kim%20and%20Ken/Bauer090.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Chrissy%20and%20Barry/22.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Lynda%20and%20Dan/52.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Amy%20and%20Brad/47.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Penny%20and%20David/26.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Kim%20and%20Ken/kimken16.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:32','2007-01-19 16:17:00','Some of my favorites of Mike\\\'s photographs','some-of-my-favorites-of-mike%5c%5c%5cs-photographs.html','/2007/1/19/',1),

We had a few days of mild weather, and then yesterday all the melted snow froze and created a thick sheet of ice on the street in front of our house.  I stepped on it, my foot slid behind me, and I crashed hard on my wrist, elbow, and knee.  Today I\\\'m in pain all over the right side of my body, including my back and neck, and I can barely put weight on my leg.  Mike says I should tell people that I hurt myself in a while rescuing an orphan in a tragic snowboard incident, but the truth is that I was just collecting our junk mail.So now I\\\'m in bed, with Advil and my laptop, missing out on a beautiful day outside.

Every year the museum puts out a new exhibit, and the 2007 exhibit tells the history of Scottsville during World War II.  They call it \\\"Small Town, Big War.\\\"Before I went full-time with my photography, I was an instructional designer, so I\\\'ve been helping the museum design their exhibits every year since 2001.  Last week my mom flew out to Colorado so we could work on the exhibit together, and we spent the week assembling stories, oral histories, artifacts, and photographs from the town\\\'s war veterans.  I put together several posters to display on the exhibit.  This collage is my favorite.  It will be seven feet tall, and will greet museum visitors near the entrance.  The image I\\\'ve posted here is an adapted version of the large collage, which we\\\'ll distribute as flyers to all the museum guests.We launch the exhibit next month, and I\\\'ll be traveling to Virginia to photograph the exhibit\\\'s opening reception.

This is Milton Cohen, an official war photographer.

I\\\'m especially happy about that, because although I signed up last Friday, I didn\\\'t start the program until Monday.  My mother was here last weekend, and we ate like the world was coming to an end:  cheese and chocolate fondue, Cold Stone Creamery, Greek food (including fried cheese), lots of wine, and god knows what else.  Then on Monday I started counting points, exercising, and basically following the WW program precisely.  I stayed within my points, exercised, and didn\\\'t miss a requisite vegetable, water, or milk all week.  I even joined a Zumba class at Springs Salsa.  I had never heard of Zumba before this week, but apparently it\\\'s so three years ago.  So forgive me if everyone else in the world has forgotten all about Zumba and has moved on to the next thing -- the Boxing Ballroom Striptease Pachanga, perhaps?  Who knows.  Fitness classes are goofy these days.  But still I really liked Zumba.  Basically it\\\'s an aerobics class that is based on salsa dance movements.  We did a variety of other dances, too, including hip hop and belly dancing.  I never got bored, and despite being completely out of shape, I enjoyed it to the end.

Thousands of photographers from around the world attend these conventions, and speakers include some of the greatest talent in the industry.  I have attended WPPI in the past, but I found it to be huge and impersonal.  For the last two years, Mike and I have chosen the DWF convention instead, because it is smaller, with closer interaction and a feeling of extended family.  I was so excited to get there and see my friends that I hadn\\\'t seen in months!  The seminars covered a wide variety of topics, including marketing, album design, bookkeeping, Photoshop, and lighting.  Every year there is also a huge tradeshow, where we can explore the latest developments in albums, cameras, and web technologies.  We came home with our heads full of new ideas, and our camera full of photos of all our friends.

Here is the story of how we got home from Vegas.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/140196654-M.jpg\\\">We went from this...<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/140203926-M.jpg\\\">... to this.</p><!--more We got bumped from our flight, and it was awesome.-->Mike and I arrived at the Vegas airport early on Friday morning to catch our flight home.  If you read my post about the party the night before, you can imagine how difficult it was for us to get to the airport by 8am.  We spent an hour in the check-in line and security line and finally got to the gate.When we got to the gate, they told us that Mike had a seat on the plane, but I was getting involuntarily bumped.  They had oversold all their flights for the weekend, and the soonest they could get me on a plane was Sunday night at midnight.  WHAT?  After I reacted to the initial shock, I said, ok, then we need a hotel room.  They said no, they don\\\'t give hotel vouchers, and even if they did, all hotel rooms in Vegas are booked because of Spring Break.  Stunned, I said, \\\"So you expect us to just sit in the airport for two and a half days?\\\" \\\"No,\\\" he explained,\\\" We only have one available seat on that Sunday night flight, so Mike is going to have to take his available seat now, and Charlotte has to wait.\\\"  I explained as nicely as I could that they had to give up the crack,  and there was no way I was going to sit an an aiport for two and a half days, and certainly not by myself.  They needed to put us on another flight, even if it is another airline.They refused.  We remained calm and tried to laugh it off.  At this point, you just have to laugh or else you\\\'ll blow a gasket. Surely overbooking shouldn\\\'t be legal.  What if I added an overbooking plan to my business model, and the bride and groom had to wait until their wedding day to find out if they made the cut:<blockquote>Charlotte:  Hi Bride and Groom.  I\\\'m overbooked today, but I can fit one of you in.  The Groom can have his pictures taken now.  Bride, it seems that you have been bumped today.Bride:  But we don\\\'t want pictures of just the Groom.  We want pictures together!Charlotte:  Don\\\'t worry, Bride, I can fit you in at midnight, two and a half days after your wedding.  Just sit over there on that bench and wait.</blockquote>Riiiiight.  Never in a million years!  So why can airlines get away with treating us like this?After much negotiating, we ended up giving up Mike\\\'s seat to one of the many people on standby.  We cashed in my ticket for a refund, and spent it on a rental car.  Despite our advanced flight reservations, we ended up driving ourselves back to Colorado.  How\\\'s that for bad customer service?  As annoyed as we are at US Airways and airlines in general, we actually had a great time on our road trip!  The trip took us through some of the most beautiful parts of the country:  The deserts of Nevada, the cliffs of Arizona, the (breathtaking) canyons of Utah, and the mountains of Colorado.  <p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/140197241-M.jpg\\\">After we cashed in our tickets, we were at the point of \\\"oh crap, what now?\\\" Here Mike is surfing the web on his phone for a plan.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/140198285-M.jpg\\\">Thank goodness the rental cars weren\\\'t overbooked!

Got bumped from my 10am flight from Denver to DC, because it was overbooked.2.  Was put on standby for a noon flight to DC, and got bumped from that flight, too.  The evil lady at the gate told me that there was no way I\\\'d get on a flight at all today, and that I had to go wait in the Customer Service line to try to get a seat on one of tomorrow\\\'s flights.  3.  Stood in Customer Service line for 2 hours and 35 minutes.4.  While I was in line, a big snowstorm hit.  Heavy snowfall, with several inches of expected accumulation over the next two days.  I did not want to go home and drive back to Denver in deep snow tomorrow.5.  While I was in line, I called Mike, and he found me a seat on an American Airlines flight heading to DC at 3pm.  We bought it, for $760.6.  Finally I made it to the customer service desk, and the \\\"service\\\" person was downright rude and condescending.  She wouldn\\\'t give me the refund that I was demanding.  I went postal.  I won\\\'t go into the details of what I said, because this is a family blog.  Let\\\'s just say that people were staring.7.  After 2.5 hours in line, I left customer service empty-handed and angry.8.  I made it to my American Airlines flight on time, but then they delayed the plane due to mechanical difficulties.  Apparently one tray table wouldn\\\'t remain upright, and they delayed our flight because of it.  People were actually shouting out, \\\"Just get duct tape!\\\" 9.

My mother is the president of this history museum in central Virginia, and she has been working incredibly hard for months to put together this wonderful exhibit.  The exhibit focused on the impact of WWII on the people of Scottsville.  It featured several local veterans and families, and the opening ceremony turned out to be a highly emotional event.Several of the featured veterans and their families attended, which made the exhibit personal and heartwarming.  Even many people who were not directly involved in the war still talked to me with vivid memories of the time period, and I loved hearing everyone\\\'s stories.  My father walked through the exhibit with me, and pointed out toys and foods that he remembers from his wartime childhood.In the picture above, the front row of the seats were occupied by several WWII vets and their spouses.  When the colonel announced the names of all the local WWII veterans, there was a palpable sadness as the museum guests remembered their friends and family from this small town.

Several veterans and their spouses sat in the front row.  During the opening presentation, the museum played a recording of Roosevelt\\\'s \\\"Day of Infamy\\\" speech.  I had heard the speech before, but I never really understood the impact that it must have had on people during that time.  As soon as Roosevelt\\\'s voice filled the museum, the older members of the audience sank a little lower in their seat, hung their heads, and closed their eyes.  I could look in their faces and see that they were remembering that day.

I didn\\\'t go to Virginia Tech, but I grew up in an area where lots of people did.  Many of the victims of yesterday\\\'s attack came from Northern Virginia, and at least one of them went to my high school.  Mary Read performed in the color guard at Annandale High School, and I was the captain of that very same color guard years ago.  My friends and their friends know people who were hurt or died, and the whole experience has been a shock to our community.My brother and I both went to the University of Virginia, which likes to think of itself as the big rival to Virginia Tech.  UVA and Tech love to hate each other, but the truth is that we are more like brothers; you and your brother can bicker all you like, but if he was ever in trouble, you\\\'d be the first one by his side.  Almost everyone at UVA has a close friend or family member at Virginia Tech.  Both my brother and I had high school best friends at Virginia Tech.  My friend, Heather, even lived in West AJ dorm our freshman year.  Lots of people from my high school went there, and some of my best friends today are Tech alumni.When the shootings occurred yesterday, I immediately wanted to drive down to Blacksburg to take photographs.  I realized, of course, that the entire world had already descended upon little Blacksburg, and the last thing they needed was yet another photographer wandering around.  I decided to do the next best thing -- go to UVA and see how my fellow Wahoos were reacting to the tragedy.Today many UVA students and faculty were wearing Virginia Tech\\\'s colors of maroon and orange.  VT flags were flying where UVA flags normally would be.  Thousands of people gathered at night for a candlelight vigil in support of their friends at Virginia Tech.  I learned today that rivalry disappears when people you know and love are hurting.  I\\\'m so glad I was there to see it all.<!--more Photos from UVA\\\'s reaction to Virginia Tech--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144673937-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Tri-Delt house, flying a VT flag<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144673967-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Beta Bridge<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144673979-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />UVA repainted this secret society \\\"Z\\\" orange and maroon.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144673996-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674013-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Students were passing out orange and maroon ribbons.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674051-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674065-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Students gathering for the vigil<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674085-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674111-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Passing out ribbons<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674129-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Thousands of people were there.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674150-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Lighting each other\\\'s candles, with a handful of cash to donate to the victims\\\' families<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674173-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674195-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674229-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674252-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674277-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674293-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674320-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />The Virginia Belles, singing \\\"More Than Words\\\"<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674354-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674384-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674404-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674436-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674480-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674496-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674511-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674519-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674535-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674569-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/144674582-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:34','2007-04-18 02:15:00','Virginia Tech vigil at the University of Virginia','virginia-tech-vigil-at-the-university-of-virginia.html','/2007/4/18/',1),

We wandered around the downtown area, and then ended the evening with drinks at their favorite Irish pub.<!--more More photos of Lisa and Tom--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694363-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694387-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694406-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694441-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694464-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150702399-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694499-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694520-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694553-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694574-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694592-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694612-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150694620-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:34','2007-05-08 04:31:00','Lisa and Tom: Portraits in Silver Spring','lisa-and-tom-portraits-in-silver-spring.html','/2007/5/08/',1),

I had never had a chance to photograph a dancer before, and as a big fan of dance, I loved this photo shoot.  Becca is a beautiful dancer with a lifelong passion and dedication to ballet.  This summer she will begin her studies at a dance academy on a well-earned scholarship.  Congratulations, Rebecca!This photo shoot had its challenges, because we were granted access to the dance studio in the evening just as the sun was going down.  I used the remaining window light for most of the pictures, and relied on my camera\\\'s beautiful image quality at high ISO.  For this photo, I placed Rebecca by a window as the main light, and I opened the two windows behind her to give a soft vignette and hair light.  I exposed for her face, and let the background go dark.  I encourage people to try window light before turning on a flash, because the results are soft and dimensional.<!--more More photos of Rebecca in her dance studio--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176674-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176677-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176695-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176667-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176610-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176622-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176633-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176649-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176743-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176749-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176758-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176780-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176793-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176827-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176836-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/151176853-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:34','2007-05-09 20:30:00','Rebecca: Portraits of a ballerina','rebecca-portraits-of-a-ballerina.html','/2007/5/09/',1),

Chris proposed to his girlfriend, Catherine, and asked me to photograph it.  It was such an honor to witness that moment in their lives.  If that weren\\\'t special enough, the proposal took place in the White House Rose Garden!Chris and Catherine have been together for five years, and they are now planning a wedding for next fall in Catherine\\\'s hometown of Ottawa, Canada.  They live in the DC area, and Chris has a friend who works in the White House.  The three of us got a private tour of the White House, including the Oval Office, Cabinet room, and Rose Garden.  It was thrilling to be standing in such important locations, imagining all the decisions that had made made in those very rooms.  I wasn\\\'t allowed to take any photographs inside the White House, but I did have a small area of the Rose Garden and the front of the White House where I was allowed to stand for photos.When we arrived in the Rose Garden, Chris pulled out a jewelry box and hid it behind his back.  He got down on one knee, and asked Catherine to marry him.

After working all morning on Saturday, we decided that we really needed a day off.  We packed up the car with our tent and our dog, and by 2pm, we were on the road for Grand County on a spur of the moment camping trip.  I just love the fact that we can take spontaneous trips to some of the most beautiful places in the country.We went to one of our favorite spots, next to Lake Granby and near Grand Lake, just south of Rocky Mountain National Park.  We camped at the edge of winding river and a lake, surrounded by snow-capped mountains.  We slept to the sounds of a nearby waterfall.  It was just what we needed.<!--more Photos from our camping trip--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/153145086-L.jpg\\\">The view from our tent<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/153145097-L.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/153145112-L.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/153145122-L.jpg\\\">Shortly after we arrived, a big rainstorm hit.

The groom, also named Mike, is the brother of my cousin\\\'s husband.  My cousin and her husband were both in the wedding party, so it was a lot of fun to spend a few days with them.  Although we hadn\\\'t met Heather and Mike, they welcomed us as family into their weekend celebrations.  They invited us to the rehearsal dinner and Sunday brunch, and the guys even invited Mike to the bachelor party.  We always love to be treated as friends, rather than vendors, but it was especially fun to be part of the family for the weekend.  By the time we went home on Sunday, we felt close to their families and friends.  I hope that closeness is reflected in our photos.Mike, the groom, is a member of the Army Cavalry, and he flies Kiowa helicopters.  Shortly after he met Heather in 2005, Mike was sent to serve in Iraq.  Heather waited for him to return, and he proposed shortly thereafter.

Paula and Tim are close friends of my parents, and my mother was the matron of honor!  They got married in beautiful Jekyll Island, Georgia, in an outdoor ceremony right along the beach.  Mike and I were thrilled that they asked us to be their photographers, because it meant a lot to us to be able to do that for them.  We decided to take a week-long vacation to relax in Savannah and Jekyll Island before their wedding day.  We stayed with my parents in a rented beach house, and spent the week with Paula and Tim and their friends and family.The wedding was gorgeous.  We loved the outdoor venue, the leaning trees, the reflections in the water, and the beautiful evening light.  Paula and Tim, thank you for including us in your wonderful celebrations all week, and thanks for introducing us to Jekyll Island.  We hope you love the photos!<!--more More photos from their wedding--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740338-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740419-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740471-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740496-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Tim, waiting for the ceremony to begin<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740599-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Paula\\\'s daughter, Lauren, peeking out to see the guests as they arrived.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740623-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Paula, my mother, and Lauren, hiding before the ceremony began<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740661-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />My mom walking down the aisle, escorted by Tim\\\'s best man, Clayton<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166756874-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Paula\\\'s son and uncle escorted her down the aisle, under a canopy of dramatic, twisting trees.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740702-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740749-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740797-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740853-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Tim and Paula, with Paula\\\'s daughter and son<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740839-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Paula\\\'s mother (right) with her two sisters<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166741001-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740875-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />After the family portraits, Mike and I took a walk on the beach with Tim and Paula.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166740901-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/166741058-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I asked them if they\\\'d be willing to walk in the water.

Before the ceremony, Michaele and Diana saw each other for the first time at the Denver Botanic Gardens, where we did group portraits among the flowers.Congratulations, Diana and Michaele!<!--more More of their photos--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064172-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Diana was surrounded by flowers in the Romantic Gardens as she waited for Michaele to arrive.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064193-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064232-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Michaele arrived to greet her bride.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064250-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064266-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064471-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064333-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064344-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064525-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Diana\\\'s veil was a family heirloom.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064538-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064853-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065598-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065674-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064882-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />A touch of pink outside the church<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064914-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064940-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Michaele\\\'s brother was the pastor for the ceremony.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064956-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171064983-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065040-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065055-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065092-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />This was so cute.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065117-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065425-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Communion<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065450-O-1.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Another candid moment right after the ceremony<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065491-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Bustling<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065526-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065544-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/171065570-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Portraits: <a href=\\\"http://www.botanicgardens.org\\\">Denver Botanic Gardens</a>Ceremony: <a href=\\\"http://www.stpauldenver.org\\\">St. Paul Lutheran Church</a>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:36','2007-07-09 05:54:00','Diana and Michaele: Denver Botanic Gardens wedding, Denver, Colorado','diana-and-michaele-denver-botanic-gardens-wedding-denver-colorado.html','/2007/7/09/',1),

I paid attention to the quality of the light in each location, and I had her turn her face up toward the naturally diffused sunlight.

Amy and Matt got married on top of a mountain at Keystone resort, and we all traveled there by ski gondola.  I had so much fun getting there that I was almost giddy by the time I got to the venue.Matt has been skiing in Keystone for years, and this resort is really important to him.  Their wedding was perfect for them, with great weather, and outdoor ceremony, and a view of the mountains.  I love it when couples plan weddings that really say a lot about their personalities.

It\\\'s surprisingly comfortable on a hike, and our harddrives and water bottles fit perfectly in it.<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/181673318-L.jpg\\\">It was fun to sit on the abandoned ski lifts.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/181673748-M.jpg\\\">After three hours of descent, we made it back to Aspen!  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/181674841-M.jpg\\\">Aspen is awesome--it\\\'s one of the most dog-friendly towns I know.

	(353,1,'** Filtered **I wasn\\\'t sure if I would write about this, because it\\\'s a part of my life that I don\\\'t like to think about very much.  But this has been a big week for me, so there are a lot of things on my mind worth writing.   Besides, some of you know about this story and would be interested an update.  Seven years ago, I was a graduate student living in Charlottesville, Virginia.  One night a man broke into my apartment while I was out, and hid in the shower until I returned.  When I got home, he attacked me and tried to rape me.  Somehow I found fierceness through my terror, and I fought him off.  He fled, leaving me traumatized but unhurt.  In the next few years, a man fitting his description and M.O. came to be known as the Charlottesville Serial Rapist.  He eluded police and attacked many other women.  DNA linked at least seven cases to one rapist, but unfortunately, my case was not among those with conclusive DNA evidence.  I\\\'ve been following the story over the years, and there may be as many as 16 cases similar to mine, all unsolved.  I was one of the lucky few who got away.  Most of the women were brutally attacked and raped.  One was injured so severely that she almost died.  Finally, here\\\'s the good news:This week, the Charlottesville police arrested Nathan Antonio Washington, the suspected serial rapist.  Apparently they have DNA evidence to link him to those crimes.  He is behind bars right now, and held without bond.  He\\\'s a 40-year-old who is married with four children.  I spoke with the Charlottesville police after I heard the news.  They suspect that I am one of his victims, and I believe the same.  They don\\\'t have strong DNA evidence in my attack, but there is still a small chance he\\\'ll be linked conclusively to my case.  I finally have some hope, and I\\\'ll be on pins and needles until I hear the results of the ongoing DNA tests.  At the very least, I am comforted to know that they finally found the man they believe to be the one.  Here is a news story from <a href=\\\"http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2007/08/16/COVER-serialrapist-E.rtf.aspx\\\">today\\\'s issue of The Hook</a> in Charlottesville.  It shows photos of the suspect, and a map of the seven cases linked to one attacker.  My case is not shown on the map, due to a lack of DNA evidence.  It took place at 3am on May 27, 2000, halfway between the Stadium and the Rotunda.  In other words, it was very close to the locations of attacks 3 and 4, which took place within weeks of mine.Now the lesson for all you strong women out there:Fight back.  Yell.  Never underestimate how strong you are.  I believe that we all have a choice to freeze or to fight, and I think the only reason I got away was that I chose not to give up.  I yelled at the top of my lungs for help, and I fought as hard as I could.  I\\\'m not trained in self-defense, I\\\'m not an athlete, and I\\\'m definitely not stronger than my attacker was.  He looks huge in that photo.  I just did everything I could to protect myself.  God forbid, if something bad ever happens to you, make a conscious decision to save yourself.  If I can do it, you can, too.  And finally, here\\\'s a big thank you to the police!','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:36','2007-08-16 20:30:00','News from Charlottesville','news-from-charlottesville.html','/2007/8/16/',1),

Jessica\\\'s well-known on this blog!  I was thrilled when she asked me for a post-wedding bridal session.  She wanted a portrait session that would feature her gown, without any worries of getting it dirty or damaged.  Some people call these sessions \\\"Trash the Dress\\\" shoots, but I prefer to think of them as \\\"Fearless Bridals.\\\"  The goal wasn\\\'t to destroy her gown, but rather to celebrate it without fear.Jessica describes her intentions far better than I could.  She asked me if she could write a post for my blog about her decision to do this photo shoot.  It\\\'s exciting for me to share Jessica\\\'s thoughts in her own words:.................................................Why?  That\\\'s your first question, isn\\\'t it?Weddings are emotional.  A wedding gown is one of the most emotionally charged pieces of clothing a woman can own.  This creates a need to keep it, to packrat it away for years and years.  I love my gown.  I love the way it hangs on my frame and I love the way my husband looked at me in it on our wedding day.  But I also had little idea what to do with the gown after the wedding.  My mother cleaned and stored hers.  A friend sold hers; another friend donated hers to Brides Against Breast Cancer; yet another friend saved hers for her daughter to wear or perhaps her christening gown.  So many options, but none held my interest. With a need to find a unique way of remembering my dress, I came across the idea of \\\"trashing\\\" it.For months I wrestled with what \\\"trashing\\\" meant.  Did it mean fire and scissors?  Did it mean mud and water?  Was it simply brides photographed in unique places?  In short, it is all of these things.  Like a wedding and its associated gown, trashing is unique unto the bride.  As I broached the subject with my husband, my parents, and my friends, the reactions were violently different from person to person.  I was definitely surprised and a little taken aback at the level of emotional investment other people had in MY gown.  But I\\\'m stubborn and I emailed Charlotte to see if she\\\'d be willing to assist me.  I was nervous asking because this shoot would require a very open mind and to my delight, Charlotte agreed with enthusiasm.  Despite having asked for help trashing my dress, the \\\"traditional monster\\\" preyed on my mind a bit.  What if the dress didn\\\'t come clean?As you can see, we shot in a church, in the woods, at a bar, in a cornfield, on a tractor, in a barn, and at the beach.  I was anxious, but with each site I let go of something else I\\\'d been holding too tight: what people would think.  Instead, I felt sexy and invincible.  I didn\\\'t care that people were videotaping the insane bride in the cornfield.  I didn\\\'t care that people were driving by either staring or honking.  I didn\\\'t care that my toes were muddy and my neck was streaked with sweat.  This photo shoot had morphed from a creative idea to NEEDED.  Treating the strongest wedding symbol with such disregard was liberating and therapeutic.  All of the things that didn\\\'t go exactly as we had planned, I didn\\\'t care anymore. The weather, the flowers, the guest list, the limo...don\\\'t care.  This shoot allowed me to move past the wedding and fully into my marriage.  As I shoved the most expensive and symbolic item of my wardrobe into a giant green trashbag to haul home, I couldn\\\'t wipe the grin off my face.  As I listened to the water swish inside the bag, I thought, \\\"Every bride needs to do this.\\\"  Now that it\\\'s done, it\\\'s time to find the best dry cleaner I can...preferably one with an open mind.Would I do it again?  In a heartbeat.-- Jessica.................................................Thank you so much, Jessica, for your eloquent contribution to my blog, and for asking me to share this experience with you.  I think I had as much fun as you did, and I hope the photos are everything you hoped for and more.Thank you also to my fantastic assistant for the day, <a href=\\\"http://www.sandersonweddings.com/\\\">Tom Sanderson</a>, who came all the way from Williamsburg to help us with this shoot.  I\\\'d also like to thank Jessica\\\'s mother for taking so many wonderful candids!

So bring on the randomness!1.  If I could do any profession other than photography, I\\\'d be a superstar on Broadway.  2.  One of these days I\\\'m going to go to New Zealand and study the impact of eco-tourism on dolphins.  Either that, or I\\\'ll go to Bali and live in a tree house for two weeks to study the self-medicating behaviors of orangutans.  Or maybe both.3.  I don\\\'t understand people who don\\\'t like vegetables.  They are seriously missing out.  My favorites are red peppers and tomatoes, and this summer I\\\'m on an arugula kick.  4.  I named my cats after chimpanzee researchers.  Janie and Roger are named after Jane Goodall and Roger Fouts.  I know that\\\'s a weird thing to do to a cat, but Goodall and Fouts are two of my heroes.  They taught me that compassion should be treasured above all traits, including intelligence.  In the late 90s, I studied sign language for six months so I could volunteer with Fouts\\\' chimps and speak to them in a shared language.  The experience changed me.  5.  When I was in fourth grade, I was on a TV game show called \\\"It\\\'s Elementary.\\\"  I was chosen to be one of their math contestants, which is funny considering I never liked math.  Somewhere my family has a VHS tape of that show, and I look really short.6.  One of my fondest memories is sitting alone in Marin County, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.  I sat there for hours, watching the fog roll in and out.  It was sublime.7.  I could win a ton of money on \\\"Don\\\'t Forget the Lyrics\\\" or \\\"The Singing Bee.\\\"  If I could clear out all the song lyrics from my brain, I could do something useful with that leftover brain power, like cure cancer.  When I was in high school, I would memorize facts for tests by putting them to music.  I can still recite the last stanza of \\\"Thanatopsis,\\\" because I sing it in my head to the tune of \\\"I\\\'d Like to Teach the World to Sing.\\\"8.

I want to scoop her up and smooch the little princess.<!--more More photos from Kenna\\\'s birthday party--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806139-O.jpg\\\">Here\\\'s Mike tossing Kenna in the air, while Robby begs for his turn.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806163-O.jpg\\\">Kenna loves her uncle Mike!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806212-O.jpg\\\">Kenna and her daddy<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806236-O.jpg\\\">Molly\\\'s sister Caitlyn (Kenna\\\'s aunt), getting in the party spirit<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806253-O.jpg\\\">Caitlyn with Robby, Molly\\\'s mother with Timmy, and my mom<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806298-O.jpg\\\">Don\\\'t you wish you had a photo of both of your grandmothers doing this at your fourth birthday party?<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806319-O.jpg\\\">Robby tastes the icing while my dad tells him no.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806339-O.jpg\\\">Kenna blows out the candles, with a little help from the boys.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806354-O.jpg\\\">Molly has the best laugh!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806372-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806401-O.jpg\\\">Baby brother Timmy wants in on the fun.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806429-O.jpg\\\">Tiggie was loving Kenna\\\'s balloon ribbon.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806447-O.jpg\\\">My dad with his adorable grandson, Timmy<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/187806467-O.jpg\\\">Molly, Robby, Kenna, and Paul, opening gifts.

This engaged couple is named Charlotte and Mike.  Charlottes and Mikes just seem to go together.Charlotte and Mike met in a yoga class, and later Mike proposed during a class.  They are both devoted practitioners, and I was enthralled by their skills!  During these poses on the rocks, I was holding my breath from awe and slight fear.  These guys are awesome.We started with a more typical engagement portrait session in the Garden of the Gods, and then we set up for some fun twilight yoga photos.  I had so much fun that I kept them there long after dark!  Charlotte and Mike are getting married in two weeks, and my Mike and I are really looking forward to it!<!--more More of their engagement portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219335-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219348-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219353-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219360-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219369-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I asked them to turn around and look at me, but they didn\\\'t want to stop kissing!<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219376-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219387-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219392-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219398-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219404-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219412-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219426-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219433-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219440-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219463-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/190219474-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I love this one.

Not only are they cool enough to share our names, but they are also a lot of fun.  Charlotte and Mike got married last weekend here in Manitou Springs, and they had the perfect night for a garden ceremony and a reception under the stars.You might remember Charlotte and Mike from their <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.livejournal.com/150274.html\\\">engagement portraits at the Garden of the Gods</a> a few weeks ago.  Their wedding ceremony ended at dusk, which left us little natural light for portraits.  Mike and I got creative with lighting!

They have known each other since they were kids, and they recently reunited after many years apart.  They soon realized that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.  They got married last Thursday in a small, outdoor ceremony at Rocky Mountain National Park.  Becky\\\'s daughter Andrea, and Mike and I were the only guests.  It was the smallest wedding we\\\'d ever photographed, and we loved how personal and intimate the whole day was. Becky and Jer will have a larger wedding next September with their families and friends.  I love the idea of having two weddings, one small and intimate, and one large and festive.EDIT: I just found out that today is Becky\\\'s birthday!

In fact, everything about this day was picture-perfect, from Grace\\\'s designer gown to their families\\\' traditional Korean costumes.  It was a gorgeous wedding.My talented friend <a href=\\\"http://www.clickphotography.net/\\\">Tamera Goldsmith</a> second-shot this wedding with me.  Mike has been off his feet for a few weeks, due to a soccer injury.  I hope he feels better soon!  Tamera, thanks so much!<!--more More photos from their wedding--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/200981285-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Air Force Academy wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" />The Air Force Academy chapel<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/200981289-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Air Force Academy wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" />Tamera and I met Johan at the chapel that morning.

Look how happy I was to be standing in the sunshine, taking an afternoon off for a long walk through Red Rock Canyon Open Space.  A couple days ago, I took Ally and my friend\\\'s dog, Idgi, for a hike through the canyon.  I took a longer path than I normally do, and I expected the walk would take about two hours.  But the weather was perfect and my spirits were so high that I just kept walking.<!--more More photos (from my old pocket camera) and the rest of the story--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204033336-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204032859-M.jpg\\\">Ally<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204033115-L.jpg\\\">Idgi<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204033564-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204033869-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204034146-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204034543-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204074172-M.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204074395-L.jpg\\\"></p>After two hours of walking, the dogs and I found ourselves on the Intemann Trail, a path that I knew would lead back toward our neighborhood.  By this time, it was getting dark, we were tired and thirsty, and the path was leading right uphill.  What I didn\\\'t know is that I\\\'d have to make some turns to remain on the Intemann.  Instead, I continued straight.  We ended up climbing an enormous hill before I realized that I was on the wrong trail.  After lots of huffing and puffing, and no water, the two dogs and I made it to the top to find only many more miles of forest ahead of us.  The sun set at 6:30, and it was now 6:40.  I called 911.<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204074450-M.jpg\\\">Part of the way up the hill... that\\\' s Red Rock Canyon below, where we had just been.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204074546-M.jpg\\\">All the way up the hill, and over the other side.  D\\\'oh.  I was feeling stupid and nervous by this point.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204426696-M-0.jpg\\\">Note the one bar of battery power on my phone.  </p>A very kind search and rescue guy didn\\\'t mock me.  After 20 minutes, he figured out where I was over the phone, and told me which paths I\\\'d need to take to get home.  I left the top of the mountain at 7pm, and he said that if he didn\\\'t hear back from me by 8pm, he would send a search party for me.  By 7pm, it was really dark.  Thank god Mike had put a tiny LED light on my keychain, because that was the only light to guide me through the pitch dark trails.  The dogs helped, too, by showing me which way to go when I couldn\\\'t see a trail.  It was a really steep descent, though, and I kept slipping and falling on rocks.The worst part, though, was my fear of wildlife.  That forest is the home of lots of scary wildlife that come out at night, including mountain lions, bears, and coyotes.  I was really scared, but managed to keep myself calm by singing \\\"99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\\\" out loud.  I hoped the noise would scare away any ill-tempered wildlife, and the repetition of the song kept me calm and distracted.   After an hour of wandering through the dark, scary forest, I finally got back to our neighborhood at exactly 8pm.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and discovered that it had gotten shattered on one of my falls on the rocks.  It had been in my back pocket, and I guess I landed hard on it.  I\\\'m so glad I didn\\\'t discover that until I got home, because I might have panicked in the woods without a functional phone.  <p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204318433-M.jpg\\\"></p>I hurried home and called the search and rescue guy just minutes after 8pm.  Then I had a very pleasant evening of Gatorade, water, Advil, ice cream, and hard-earned common sense.  Then yesterday I decided that I can\\\'t live more than a day without a cell phone, so I made a trip up to Denver.<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/204318499-M.jpg\\\">How\\\'s that for making lemons into lemonade?

They are getting married one year from tomorrow.  Happy negative one year anniversary, guys!  Mike and I clicked with Amanda and Eric right away, and we are really looking forward to getting to know them over the coming year.Amanda and Eric have one of the coolest volunteer jobs I know: they train puppies to be guide dogs for the blind.  They train and socialize dogs for the first year of their lives, before sending them off to a school for them to learn how to assist the blind.  Only a small percentage of the dogs in this program are selected to be placed with a blind companion.  Right now Amanda and Eric are training a yellow lab named Anthony, and they have adopted Nasa, one of their former puppies who was not selected for the program.  Mike and I are so fascinated with the work that Amanda and Eric do that we are considering getting involved, too.

They communicated via American Sign Language.  The sign language study began as an effort to evaluate the intelligence of primates.  Years of communicating via this shared language enabled the researchers to learn so much about the chimps\\\' thoughts and emotions that the Fouts concluded a lesson that has always resonated with me: Compassion is the trait that should be valued above all others, including intelligence.Years ago, I read Roger Fouts\\\' book, <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Next-Kin-My-Conversations-Chimpanzees/dp/0380728222\\\"><i>Next of Kin</i></a>, about his work with these chimps.  This book changed my outlook on the world so substantially that I decided I needed to meet Fouts and Washoe.  I studied sign language for six months, and then went to Washington to do a volunteer project with them.  That experience was one of the most significant moments in my self-development.  Shortly afterward, I decided to become a vegetarian. Today I am so sad to learn that Washoe has died.  She died of natural causes, and I know she was well-loved to the end.

On Christmas Eve, the five of us will be going to the Denver Performing Arts Center to see \\\"White Christmas,\\\" and then we\\\'ll be spending Christmas Day here at our house.  I\\\'ve been assembling family recipes from the cookbooks my aunt prepared for all of us, and I can\\\'t wait to make my grandmother\\\'s sugar cookies, Gayle\\\'s pumpkin bread, and my mom\\\'s black bottom cupcakes.  The only problem is that I\\\'m the only vegetarian in the group, so we have to come up with a Christmas menu that will appeal to herbivores and omnivores alike.  I\\\'m enjoying the challenge.  Does anyone have suggestions?....................I love movies this time of year.  I want to see \\\"Enchanted,\\\" \\\"August Rush,\\\" and \\\"Sweeney Todd,\\\" and I can\\\'t wait to get \\\"Hairspray\\\" on DVD.  As much as I admired Khaled Hosseini\\\'s book, I think I\\\'ll skip \\\"The Kite Runner\\\" movie.  It is just too traumatic for me to see.  Has anyone read \\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\\" yet?

Those of you who knew him years ago would barely recognize him these days.

What have I been doing with my free time?  Baking!  I\\\'ve made peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, banana bread, peppermint bark, and sugar cookies, but my favorite project has been a batch of gingerbread cookies.  I\\\'d never made gingerbread before, so it was fun to learn how to do it.  For some reason I\\\'m surprised that they actually taste good!  I had so much fun decorating the cookies with my dad and Mike yesterday.

The DWF is a group of some of the most passionate and fun people that I\\\'ve had the privilege of knowing.  I\\\'ve made so many friends, and I miss them already.  I wish I didn\\\'t have to wait another year to see them all again.I took tons of photos with my little point-and-shoot. It\\\'s not the most reliable camera, but it was handy to have it with me at all times!** EDITED to add horrendously embarrassing video.<!--more More photos from the DWF convention--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/241243267-O.jpg\\\">We all stayed at the this Hyatt next to the water.  The palm trees were a refreshing change of scenery from snowy Colorado!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/241243424-O.jpg\\\"></p>On Thursday night, lots of us (a hundred, maybe?) went to a nearby dive bar for karaoke. I was the first DWFer to sing (Sweet Child of Mine, if you\\\'re curious), and the gang cheered for me like some kind of rockstar.  I felt like a total diva with all the cameras, video cameras, and video lights in my face.  It was awesome.  Does anyone out there have pictures?  If so, I\\\'d love to see them!**EDITED to add:I need to be careful what I wish for.  I can\\\'t believe I\\\'m doing this, but I\\\'m a glutton for punishment.

On Saturday, the Digital Wedding Forum staged the \\\"Wedding from Hell,\\\" starring our fellow photographers as actors in the most comical wedding that I ever hope to witness.  Four DWF members were selected to photograph the wedding and its preparations, to demonstrate to us how they handle difficult situations.The wedding featured all kinds of difficulties, including a bride who was 6\\\'2\\\", and a groom who was 5\\\'2\\\".  The mother of the bride wouldn\\\'t stop wailing or criticizing the bride\\\'s hair.  The groomsmen were wasted, and were even passing the vodka around during the ceremony.  The bridemaids were smoking and adjusting their cleavage during the ceremony.  A guest stood in the middle of the aisle with his huge tripod, blocking the view.  The wedding coordinator presented the photographers with a 17-page list of formal portraits.  The groom\\\'s stepmother was dressed like a tramp and trying to steal the show.  The four photographers were sweating the whole time.  The rest of us were laughing our heads off.I took lots of photos that day, all of which were taken with my point-and-shoot from a safe distance.  ;-)<!--more More photos from this mock wedding, and also from the dance club later that night--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/241243632-O.jpg\\\"></p>The wedding began in the ballroom, with a bedroom set for the bride to get ready.

I took Mike to Breckenridge today for his birthday, and surprised him with a dogsledding trip.  It was fantastic!  Those dogs were the friendliest, happiest little bundles of energy.  As most of you know, Mike and I love dogs, so it was great to see these doggies so excited to be romping around in the snow.  Whenever we stopped, they were eager to start running again.  We took turns driving the sled and riding as a passenger.  On the uphill stretches, the passenger would get out to lighten the dogs\\\' load, and ride in the sleigh pulled by our guide\\\'s skidoo.  I took many of these photos and video from the bumpy skidoo, which was tricky.  But it was a great ride.  Thank you so much for all the birthday wishes for Mike!

We set up the dining room table with dishes and appliances like the microwave and George Foreman grill.  Boxes of kitchen stuff are everywhere.  Extension cords run throughout the room.  I hate living in a mess.  I figured that it might be the dust and construction debris that were causing my headache, so Mike and I left the house and worked from a coffee shop for few hours today.  After 20 minutes or so away from home, I felt much better.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/252230390_nXgC9-O.jpg\\\">When we got home this afternoon, the kitchen looked like this.  I\\\'m so excited to be able to move on to the painting, cabinets, and other fun stuff next week!  In the meanwhile, I\\\'ll be at the coffee shop a lot this weekend. ;-)','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:41','2008-02-08 21:13:00','Kitchen remodeling day 5: Not much to look at','kitchen-remodeling-day-5-not-much-to-look-at.html','/2008/2/08/',1),

Sara and Cary got married at Lost Creek Ranch in Silverthorne, Colorado a few months ago.  They chose a 9\\\"x12\\\" Fine Art Book with 40 pages.  The Fine Art Book is a contemporary album that really suits Sara and Cary\\\'s artistic style.  She is a graphic designer, and the flower image on the back cover is her own design.<!--more More pages from their album--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/219239760_ZyRDX-M-1.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I love the way that the natural scenery matched their wedding\\\'s color scheme.

Not all of them are installed, though; some are just sitting there, waiting their turn.  But at least I can finally visualize what this kitchen is going to look like!  The color is a little off in this picture, though, because the wood looks a bit yellower here than it does in real life.Today the guys are working on plumbing, the phone line, and leveling the counters.  For a while we had a flooding issue that they managed to resolve while I remained blissfully ignorant.  It had something to do with a \\\"bib\\\" that wasn\\\'t right.  I sat on my comfy couch in the basement and tried not to worry as the guys ran around the house to stop the water.  I\\\'m not wet, so I guess all is good.  ;-)Our appliances, flooring, and appliances have arrived.  They aren\\\'t installed yet, but I took pictures anyway.

This is actually our granite backsplash, but I\\\'ve placed it here to show how beautifully it matches the maple cabinets.  Isn\\\'t it perfect?

There was no conclusive evidence in my case, so the police warned me that I\\\'d probably never have closure.  This week he confessed to my attack.His name is Nathan Antonio Washington, known for years as the Charlottesville serial rapist.  He committed a series of rapes and violent assaults over ten years.  He has been found guilty of five of the attacks, and this week he was sentenced to four life sentences plus twenty years.  On Tuesday I got a phone call from the police with the news I never expected to receive.  Washington confessed to some of his other attacks, including mine.  The police think that I am among at least 15 victims in his ten-year streak.  I was one of the few who fought him off and got away unharmed.  The emotional trauma has been terrible at times, though.  This week has been tough for me as I\\\'ve been reliving the experience and learning more information about it. Apparently he stalked me for a month, watching me through my windows and studying my habits. He\\\'s behind bars, gone for good.  I have closure.  Still I feel trembly this week.  Now that I know for sure that it was Washington in my home, I keep thinking about all the terrible things that evil man could have done.  I can\\\'t believe I got away safely when so many women didn\\\'t.  The good news is that it\\\'s over now, and every day is going to get better for me and many other people.<a href=\\\"http://www.nbc29.com/Global/story.asp?S=7926590&nav=menu496_2_4\\\">Story here, via NBC</a><a href=\\\"http://www.nbc29.com/Global/story.asp?S=7935596&nav=menu496_2_4\\\">Story about the victims</a>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:42','2008-02-28 17:25:00','Closure finally','closure-finally.html','/2008/2/28/',1),

I wish women\\\'s sports could be this popular without fishnets and naughty nicknames, but it was still a fun night out, and I\\\'ll definitely go back another time.<!--more More roller derby photos--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723250_B6pjp-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723228_f3r2w-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I\\\'m not sure what\\\'s up with the referee\\\'s codpiece here.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723234_BvLJA-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723247_ZseEA-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723256_9kSap-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723270_kq6Lo-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />The halftime show was a group performing <a href=\\\"http://www.capsprings.com\\\">Brazilian Capoeira</a>.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723280_aNj2x-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />This can\\\'t be easy!<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723286_A7JwR-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Even the kids were fantastic.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723299_zqK8L-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723312_SCocF-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723336_C8WxQ-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723323_jx7wH-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723343_YWcpx-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723347_upKdF-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/263723356_tcxpX-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />The ref was saying something about four.

I haven\\\'t taken any new pics since then.  </p>It doesn\\\'t look much different today, even though they worked all week, and it\\\'s not done yet.  I realize now that the contractor\\\'s original estimate of a two-week project was unrealistic, but I never expected it to be incomplete after six weeks.  I want my kitchen finished and my normal routine back, please.  Otherwise, I love the kitchen!  It feels much larger and brighter in there now.  The granite counters are gorgeous, the maple cabinets are luscious, and the stainless appliances are much more contemporary.  I love it all!  Since this photo was taken, our contractor Michael widened the doorway by the refrigerator, textured and painted the new doorway, painted the ceiling, insulated the ceiling, and fixed a plumbing problem.  After all that work, today it looks pretty much the same as it did when I took this photo a week ago.  The details left to do include painting the window frames in the kitchen and dining room, installing the cabinet hardware, and adding some task lighting.  It should be all done by the end of next week, I hope!<!--more More photos of the kitchen progress--><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/264059705_ohk5Y-O.jpg\\\">I think this is we left off last time, four weeks into the project.  I hosted this month\\\'s book club meeting at our house, and had hoped to entertain with a sparkly new kitchen that day, but this is how it looked when the ladies came over.

That was huge, because that meant we could wash dishes.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/264059632_BQKyK-O.jpg\\\">Ahhhh, it\\\'s looking so pretty.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/264059628_HMoQe-O.jpg\\\">OK, this wasn\\\'t a fun moment.  This was a week ago, at the end of the day on Friday.  Randy and Michael had finished most of the big projects, and finally installed the refrigerator.  We would have a fully-functional, mostly finished kitchen for the weekend!  Then they discovered that we couldn\\\'t open the freezer door.  The newly-drywalled doorway didn\\\'t give enough room for the door to open.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/264059625_savzE-O.jpg\\\">AAARRRGGH.None of us saw that coming.  This problem ended up costing us an extra week and several hundred dollars to fix.  Michael spent the last week ripping out the doorway, widening it by six inches or so, adding new drywall, retexturing the wall, and painting it.  This afternoon the wall was all dried and finished, so we slid the refrigerator back into place.  It fits great now!  I will take pictures of it later, but the wall is looking great now (thanks, Michael!).  I hope to post finished photos next weekend!  But who knows what will come up between now and then.  ;-)','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:42','2008-03-15 21:06:00','Kitchen remodeling day 41: The devil is in the details','kitchen-remodeling-day-41-the-devil-is-in-the-details.html','/2008/3/15/',1),

It\\\'s been two months exactly since our awesome ski trip with four of my friends, but I haven\\\'t downloaded any of the photos from my camera until today.  I got some fun pictures, though!In January, two of my best friends and their husbands came from Virginia to spend a week with us in Colorado.  We rented a big condo in Breckenridge, near the ski lifts and the main street.  It\\\'s not often that I plan a big vacation with a group of friends, so this was a dream come true in some ways.  That\\\'s why it sucked so much that I was sick that week.  *cry*  I spent the first evening of our trip in bed.  The second day I skied for about an hour, which is when I took these photos.  The rest of the week I stayed off the slopes and took it easy.  I had a lot of fun hanging out with the gang at restaurants and coffee shops, but I still wish I hadn\\\'t been sick that week!  I don\\\'t get to see my closest friends as often as I\\\'d like, so it was such an unfortunate time to get hit with that bug that\\\'s been going around.Heather, Scott, Kathy, and Eddie, thanks so much for coming out to Colorado!

We spent most of that time living in a dusty mess, with a microwave in the basement and a refrigerator in the garage.  We ate crappy processed food, and contributed to more than our fair share of global disaster with all the disposable dishes and utensils we used.  About five weeks into the process, I found myself at the grocery store, buying yet another week\\\'s worth of supplies for our little family of basement dwellers.  I pulled out my cell phone, because I had to take a picture of my sad shopping cart:  frozen food, cat litter, and single-servings of Ben and Jerry\\\'s.  I must have looked like a depressed cat lady.  I\\\'m happy to say that all the construction is finally finished!  The kitchen is looking gorgeous, and we are finally cooking real food in there!  We\\\'re eating produce and fresh ingredients!  It looks so pretty that I can\\\'t wait to have everyone I know over to see it.  At this point, we\\\'re just waiting for a few accessories that we ordered online to arrive, like the new roman shade. I\\\'ll take the final set of remodeling photos this weekend or early next week, after everything arrives.What else have I been doing with my time lately?  I haven\\\'t been taking many photos, which is why I\\\'ve neglected my blog.  It\\\'s been a great month, though.  I\\\'ve been resting up to prepare for our wedding season, which begins early for us this year.  We get rolling with weddings next week!  In the meanwhile, I\\\'ve had enough time in March to work on client albums and our marketing materials, as well as lots of other stuff.<!--more What I\\\'ve been up to-->-- I got back into an exercise routine, and I feel much better as a result.  I have been walking 3-4 miles a day, 5 times a week.  Feels great!  -- I joined a book club with some really fun, intelligent, and insightful women.  I look forward to it each month.  This month we\\\'re reading <i>Love in the Time of Cholera.</i>-- I started yoga classes, taught by my friend (and former client!), Mike.  He\\\'s an excellent teacher and totally cool guy.  Check it out: http://www.thebijastudio.com/-- I designed part of an exhibit for the <a href=\\\"http://avenue.org/smuseum/\\\">Scottsville Museum</a>, in Scottsville, Virginia.

Here\\\'s a picture she sent me of the poster I designed and emailed to her:<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/270872308_dRdRW-O.jpg\\\"></p>-- I am sprucing up our house, by painting, wood staining, and decorating.  Now that the kitchen is pretty, I\\\'m in love with our house and want to make it gorgeous.  Unfortunately now I have cherry wood stain on my arms, and can\\\'t get it off.  I look like I bled all over myself.  That must go away before next week\\\'s wedding!  Any suggestions?-- I\\\'ve been looking for commercial studio/office space for my business.  The business is going strong, and eventually I want to have a killer studio and showroom.  Until then, my clients should come check out our cool house.  ;-)-- I\\\'ve been taking care of my sick little angel kitty, Roger.  The poor guy is deteriorating rapidly from his diabetes, and he\\\'s responded badly to any kind of insulin the vets have tried.  Finally I\\\'ve decided to take him off the insulin, and let him live out his remaining months happily.  The little guy is losing weight drastically, but he\\\'s happier than I\\\'ve seen him in over a year, so that is comforting for me.-- Last, and definitely least, I\\\'ve been watching more reality shows than I should probably admit.  I\\\'m a total addict!  My favorite TV star recently is Christian from Project Runway... hot tranny fierceness!  And I\\\'ve been hooked on American Idol since season 1, although this year\\\'s season is a bit dull.  I don\\\'t have a favorite yet, do you?  I can\\\'t forget the Bachelor... as a big fan of English men, I\\\'m going to love this season.  I\\\'m also hooked on America\\\'s Best Dance Crew... have you seen that one?  It\\\'s on MTV and really cool.  I can\\\'t wait for So You Think You Can Dance to start up!  That one might be my favorite reality indulgence of all.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:43','2008-03-26 21:25:00','Update in the life of Char','update-in-the-life-of-char.html','/2008/3/26/',1),

It was a hilarious moment after a wedding that we shot together last fall.  After the wedding ended, she and I sat down to eat some leftover cake.  As we were chatting, the hired clown came over and joined us.  He was a totally nice guy, but Tamera has a bit of a clown phobia.  I just love the look on her face when he decided to sit next to her.  Her eyes almost popped out of her head, and she looked at me like, \\\"Holy crap, what do I do now?\\\"  He started chatting with us, oblivious to the fact that Tamera was afraid of him.  It took all my willpower not to burst out laughing.','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:43','2008-03-30 17:42:00','Tamera\\\'s new friend','tamera%5c%5c%5cs-new-friend.html','/2008/3/30/',1),

I knew that friends of Teddi and Keith would be a lot of fun!  Sarah and Marx were laid-back and up for anything.

We flew out to San Diego to visit my fifth grade teacher, Mr. C.  He\\\'s Rick Campbell to the rest of the world, but I\\\'ve called him Mr. C for years.  Mr. C was the best teacher I\\\'ve ever had, and and several of my classmates have all kept in touch with him over the years.  You can read more about our fifth grade class here: http://charlottegeary.livejournal.com/105356.html (and even see our class photo from 1984!)This spring, Mr C gave me the amazing opportunity to teach photography at his school in San Diego.  It was a great honor to be invited, and also a wonderful chance to spend time with him and his wife.  Mike and I had never been to San Diego before, and we loved it instantly.  I hadn\\\'t expected it to be so lush and green, with flowers everywhere!  Mr C showed us around town on Wednesday, and took us on a beautiful walk along the shores in La Jolla.  Afterward, we ate lunch on the patio at George\\\'s on the Cape, with an amazing view of the water.  Tomorrow I\\\'ll post photos the next day, when we spent the day at Mr C\\\'s school, and I taught photography to the fourth-graders.

Mr. C is now the technology coordinator at an independent elementary school in San Diego.  His school has several Canon point-and-shoot cameras, and he invited me to come teach the students how to use them.  When these kids are in the fifth grade next year, they will be responsible for much of the photography in their school\\\'s yearbook, so  it\\\'s time for them to learn some basic principles of composition. These nine-year-olds are smart, creative, and bold!  They learned quickly, and were bursting with enthusiasm.  Later that day, Mr C and I went through all their photos, and we were really surprised by some of them.  Most of the students followed the rules of composition that I taught, but several of them took those rules a step further to really tell a story or create something meaningful.

It\\\'s especially comforting to know that so many of us have gone through similar experiences, and I thank you for understanding how hard it is to lose a pet.  I have such great friends out there!  I love you all.Yesterday I collected some photos of Roger through the years.  Actually I regret not taking more photos of my little guy.  I have tons of pictures of the dog, but not nearly enough of the cats.  I treasure the few photos that I have.  Most of my pictures of him were taken on film, and maybe someday I\\\'ll scan them to share.  In the meanwhile, I hope you enjoy getting to know Roger through the photos that I already had digitized.  He was sweet-natured, friendly, cuddly, and laid-back.  If you had come over to our house, he\\\'d probably try to sit in your lap as soon as you arrived.  In his later years, he was gentle with me as I gave him his shots, eye drops, and daily baths.  He was always happy to see me.  Cats don\\\'t get sweeter than Rog.Edited to add: Wow, thank you so much, everyone.  I really appreciate all the support and compassion.

They were only about three months old.  We had moved into my apartment in Charlottesville, where I was starting grad school.  I was living on my own for the first time, and they helped me through the happy and sad times.The next several photos were taken with my webcam while I was a grad student.

It means so much to me to receive such a thoughtful thank you.  They gave me permission to post it here, so I thought I\\\'d share.  Thanks, Nicole and Matt!<blockquote>Charlotte &amp; Mike,You are amazing! We got home late last night and I stayed up as long as I could looking at the photos. I can\\\'t wait to go home tonight and just get the chance to settle in and look at all of them.Honestly, I don\\\'t want to sound too gushy- but I am just overwhelmed by these photographs.  On one hand, I feel like you captured the entire day in such an honest, real way which I absolutely love- but on the other hand, I also think we now have beautiful pieces of art to put on our walls and share with our grandchildren one day. I don\\\'t know if words can adequately express how much these photographs mean to  both of us.You and Mike were so willing to put yourselves out there and basically become part of our family for the weekend. The time you took to get to know people and learn about our family and friends makes the photos you took just that much more personal and meaningful to us. By the end of the weekend, we felt like you and Mike were old friends.That said, we hope you will stay friends! You have a standing invitation for a ski weekend anytime- or a dinner date if you two ever find yourselves in Aspen again. And you have solidified your position in our lives as the official Burg Family Photographer...Im already dreaming up excuses for another photoshoot.So, thanks for everything, both of you.Love, Nicole and Matt</blockquote>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:44','2008-05-16 16:39:00','Email from Nicole','email-from-nicole.html','/2008/5/16/',1),

She asked if I could shoot the wedding with her, so that there would be an experienced photographer at the wedding in case she was unable to do it.  I canceled my plans for the day and promptly started getting my equipment ready.  Mike overhead the phone call, and he started charging my batteries before I even got off the phone!  What a great guy.  :)  I\\\'m happy to say that Holly made it through the wedding, but it was a tough day for her, and I\\\'m glad I was able to help her out.Emilie and Joey got married at <a href=\\\"http://www.hillsidegardens.net/\\\">Hillside Gardens</a>, a nursery and event center in downtown Colorado Springs.  I loved its view of the mountains!  The weather couldn\\\'t have been more perfect, at about 80 degrees with soft clouds and a breeze.  Afterward, they danced in an open-air pavilion as the sun set over the mountains.Congratulations, Emilie and Joey, and thank you for making me feel welcome on such short notice!  Holly, I hope you feel better soon!<!--more More photos of their wedding--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054895_rmCa3-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054526_xtbxN-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054711_A3s7Q-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054820_sC2sA-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />It was an emotional day for Emilie\\\'s mom.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054857_cAuoo-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054933_sj3oU-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Joey and the pastor are good friends and shared an emotional moment together just before the ceremony.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/298054996_nNmjY-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Emilie\\\'s dad, waiting to walk her down the aisle.

Last week Mike and I took my Mom to Aspen for a bike tour of the beautiful Maroon Bells region.  My father had to cut his CO trip short to get some work done, so unfortunately he wasn\\\'t able to join us for this great trip.  Still the three of us had a lot of fun.  I only wish we could have stayed longer!  A few days in Aspen cost as much as a week anywhere else in the state, so we had to make our time there count.  Speaking of the high costs in Aspen, we decided to visit a condo\\\'s open house while we were there, out of curiosity.  It was a 1000 square foot apartment with two bedrooms and a 70s-era exterior.  It was nice, but nothing special, except for its location in downtown Aspen.  The asking price was $2.3 million.  Yeah, my dreams of living in that blissful town pretty much evaporated at that point.  But I can see why it\\\'s so expensive there.  Aspen really is a delight.  I\\\'m just grateful that we live only a few hours away and can visit.

I\\\'ve finally finished designing our wedding album!  I\\\'m so excited!For those who don\\\'t already know, Mike is British, and we got married in his hometown of Wells, Somerset.  Our ceremony and reception took place at the Swan Hotel, across the street from the medieval Wells Cathedral.  We had our portraits taken at the cathedral and neighboring Bishops Palace.This is by far the largest album I\\\'ve ever designed, and it has taken me two weeks to prepare it.  It features the work of our fabulous photographer, <a href=\\\"http://www.photojennic.co.uk/\\\">Jenni Le Roux</a>, as well as  photos from my mother and our good friends Richard and Sarah.  All three of them are great photographers, too, and we\\\'re so grateful that they could help us document the wedding.  I even threw in a few photos that I took myself before the wedding.  :)Our album will be a 12x12 flushmount album with a leather cover and leather case.

Mike and I flew out to San Francisco to photograph the wedding of Kristen and Yaki.  It\\\'s always a huge honor to be invited to travel to people\\\'s weddings, and San Francisco was particularly fantastic.  It\\\'s perhaps my favorite city in the world, so it was a thrill to go back.  Kristen and Yaki made the experience even better, because they had such a fun, laid-back attitude about their wedding.On Friday evening, we met with Kristen and Yaki for their engagement session.  It was only one day before their wedding, so we helped them celebrate their final day of engagement!  Kristen chose Fort Mason as a waterfront setting for their photos.  It gave us lots of great locations for portraits, including lush green trees and dramatic warehouses along the water.  The only problem was that the fog completely hid the Golden Gate Bridge (and the rest of the city) during our entire time in SF.  Next time I\\\'ll come back in the spring or fall!Mike and I had so much fun with Kristen and Yaki over the weekend.  Stay tuned later in the week for photos of their wedding at a winery in Sonoma!<!--more More of their engagement portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692677_e5xHf-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692685_cFZhq-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692699_YF5BY-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692735_vBN47-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692750_2efPj-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692784_YcGa9-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692807_NKMo7-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692859_At6nd-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692712_vPs7Y-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692899_WSepP-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692919_4QEFT-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692954_DJbk7-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/354692964_vM9nC-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />It was really cold and windy!

They got married at a winery in the Sonoma Valley, in a colorful garden surrounded by vineyards.  Their reception took place inside a huge room filled with barrels and the sweet aroma of wine.  Mike and I had never photographed a wedding at a winery, and we loved it!  We especially loved Kristen\\\'s free-spirited approach to being a bride, and all the hilarious moments with her equally fun friends.  What made this wedding particularly special were the people who had traveled long distances to be there, including Yaki\\\'s parents who had come all the way from Israel.Congratulations, Kristen and Yaki!

Mike\\\'s good friend Richard got married, and we flew to the UK to be there.  Mike went to college at Reading University with Richard.  They were lab partners at university, and after they graduated, the two of them drove around the USA together on an eight-week road trip.  Richard has been a great friend to Mike through the years, and I liked him instantly when we met.  He has come out to the States to visit us twice in the last few years, including a great trip to my uncle\\\'s farm in Virginia (<a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.livejournal.com/112166.html\\\">photos from that trip are here</a>).We met Lizzie for the first time at the wedding, and she is perfect for Richard!  The wedding took place at her family\\\'s gorgeous home in a village in Wiltshire.  I couldn\\\'t believe that the weather was warm and sunny -- it was probably the best weather I\\\'ve ever seen on any of my trips to England.  I took some nice portraits of the two of them in the grounds around her family\\\'s home, and then I put away my camera to be a guest for the night.Congratulations, Lizzie and Richard!  I hope your lovely sunshine travels with you to Barbados!<!--more More photos from their wedding--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/362807708_cTmUn-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />We arrived at the church, and a very dapper Richard was greeting guests out front.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/362807583_uqBsb-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Richard carried a pocketwatch that had belonged to his grandfather.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/362807805_7qVu7-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I like this one of the best man, Gareth, with his daughter, Isabella.

As a result, I ended up without photos of some of the best moments throughout the night.  Fortunately Richard\\\'s friend took some photos of Mike and me attempting synchronized flips on the bouncy castle.  I can\\\'t wait to see those.A live band played until midnight, and then the bride and groom left and the after-party began.  I changed into jeans and danced to the iPod DJ until almost 2.  There were so many thoughtful touches at this wedding -- for example, just as I was feeling hungry late into the dance party, a \\\"chip van\\\" arrived at the reception, with free french fries for all.  Niiiiice.  The same van came back at 9am, to serve breakfast to those of us who camped out.Thank you to Lizzie\\\'s family for hosting such a fun and thoughtful party!  And thank you to Richard for being such a good friend to my Mikey through the years.

We traveled there to photograph a wedding, but we scheduled our trip to give us some free time to explore the city and visit friends.  We didn\\\'t take many personal photos on that trip, but I thought I\\\'d post the few that we took.It\\\'s bizarre to me that August is so cold in San Francisco!  The fog was thick every day of our trip, and we could barely see the Golden Gate Bridge.  We drove over to the Marin Headlands for a scenic view of the Bay, but all we could see was an occasional glimpse of a foggy bridge.  The wind was blowing so fiercely that the fog whirled up the cliffs and past us like a rushing stream.  It was a fascinating phenomenon.We walked all over that lovely city, climbing the wacky hills almost effortlessly.  It\\\'s fun to live at high altitude and travel to sea level, because the extra oxygen in our blood makes us feel invincible.

It was thrilling for me to be there, because I lived in Frankfurt when I was a kid.  I haven\\\'t been back since we moved away in 1988, so Mike and I decided to go visit Frankfurt this summer, twenty years later.  The 13-year-old, German side of myself seems like a whole lifetime ago, so it was bizarre to go back and reawaken that part of my brain.  It was a relief to discover that I remembered so much of the language and I could still navigate easily around town.  I found my family\\\'s apartment building and took Mike on a tour of all my favorite playgrounds.  Ha!  I gave him the children\\\'s tour of Frankfurt!Do I have any friends in Frankfurt who are reading this blog?  If so, let me say how much I love your city!  I\\\'ll always love Frankfurt since I spent so much time there in my youth, but beyond that, it\\\'s just a beautiful, stylish, friendly city that is a joy to visit again after all these years.  I wish we could have stayed longer.  <!--more More photos from our trip--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/366151596_kFLoD-O.jpg\\\">We stayed at the Radisson SAS hotel, which was a funky blue circle on the outside, and sleek and stylish inside.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/366151659_Gmvp8-O.jpg\\\">Inside the hotel.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/366149065_dzwjS-O.jpg\\\">On the first day, we romped around in the rain and wandered through the city.

When my brother and I were kids, we made the mistake of telling her that we\\\'d seen a drug deal go on in this very spot at GrÃ¼neberg Park.  From that moment on, we were never allowed to go to that park without a parent.  I suppose she feared that we\\\'d buy drugs.  So I finally had the chance to go there without Mom and Dad, so obviously I brought a 50 Euro note and stood in that spot and waited.  :-D<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/366149610_mqKRL-O.jpg\\\"></p>The German people are so bilingual that signs everywhere flipped back and forth between German and English. I got such a chuckle out of all the Germlish we encountered everywhere.  I feel really lucky to have grown up speaking an internationally recognized language, and I\\\'m humbled by how much the people of Frankfurt made an effort to speak to us in English.  Foreign visitors in the US or UK wouldn\\\'t find the same in return, unfortunately.  <p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/366149670_p4wXK-O.jpg\\\">Yesterday we had lunch at this cafe.

As many of you already know, my husband Mike is British, and he grew up in a Somerset village near the town of Wells.  Today we took a nice walk through Wells, and I decided to bring my camera to photograph random things that I saw along the way.Wells is a gorgeous medieval town that has been around since at least 700AD.  The focal point of the city is the Wells Cathedral and its accompanying Bishop\\\'s Palace.  The Cathedral School has been in existence since 909 and is still filled with students today.  I can\\\'t even imagine going to a school that has been around for a millennium. Mike went to the Wells Blue School, which is much younger -- it wasn\\\'t founded until 1652.  His hometown really puts American history in perspective!  My high school in Virginia was one of the oldest in the county; it was about 40 years old at the time.Wells retains its medieval charm, but now most of its old buildings are occupied by modern cafes and stylish shops.  It\\\'s a lovely place to wander around on a late summer day.<!--more More photos from Wells--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/368605407_JnKur-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Vicar\\\'s Close.

He got some great pictures of them!When we were in San Francisco last month for Kristen and Yaki\\\'s wedding, we stayed at the beautiful Hotel Nikko.  One evening we came down into the lobby and saw the very distinctive Constantine Maroulis towering over a crowd of adoring ladies.  Constantine was in our hotel lobby?  It was a surreal moment.  Then I realized that David Hernandez and Vonzell Solomon were also there, chatting with the fans.  I talked with the concierge to see what was going on, and he explained that they were giving a concert there every evening.As you probably know, I have a bit of a reality show problem, so naturally I bought two tickets for the next night\\\'s show.  Mike brought his camera and took great photos from our front row seats.  Afterward we chatted with Constantine and Vonzell in the hotel bar.  Mike showed Vonzell the photos and she loved them and asked for copies.  Now that I\\\'ve had some time to process the photos, I\\\'ll email them to her as she requested.  Mike got some great photos!<!--more More photos of Vonzell, Constantine, and David from American Idol--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/360379808_u6SDS-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />David Hernandez<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/360379869_UpzsA-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/360379933_moMwW-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/360379985_VQqSm-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Vonzell looked gorgeous on stage, and Mike\\\'s camera liked her.

Amanda and Eric train puppies for the guide dog program, and I\\\'m fascinated by the work that they do.  Their two dogs attended the wedding, including one who is leaving for his official guide dog training later this month.

The crowds danced in the middle of the street until the street light changed.  When the cars had a green light, the crowds hurried off to the sidewalk and waited to resume the party until the pedestrian crosswalk light turned green again!  \\\"Yes we can... obey traffic laws!\\\" one guy shouted.  Hysterical.Watch the traffic light change in this one:<lj-embed id=\\\"11\\\"/>Here\\\'s a fun clip of a guy giving Mike a high five:<lj-embed id=\\\"12\\\"/>Finally the cops arrived and everyone assumed they\\\'d force the crowds to leave.

We get together for pub quizzes, coffees, and photographer parties, but for some reason we\\\'ve never gone shooting together.  So today was fun!Mike and I started the afternoon at Red Rock Canyon, where Tamera photographed us doing one of our favorite things -- hiking with our dog.  Then Tamera and I met up with her boyfriend Pat to explore some areas near their home.  We went to a run down motel with the goofy name \\\"Dun Rovin\\\'\\\", and then to a car dealership that was selling a fabulous Airstream trailer.  It was all hilarious and a lot of fun.Thanks so much, Tamera!

They traveled from Oklahoma to Colorado Springs, where they had a tiny but beautiful wedding at Pauline Chapel.  Their wedding was the smallest I\\\'ve photographed -- the only participants were Lea and David, the officiant, and me.  I loved being a part of their wedding celebration, and documenting it for all their family and friends who were unable to be there.  Instead of hosting a reception, Lea and David chose to celebrate their wedding with a two-day extended portrait session at the Broadmoor.  It was a thrill for me to have so much time with them for posed pictures in such a gorgeous setting.On Saturday, we spent a couple hours wandering the Broadmoor after their ceremony.  The resort\\\'s Christmas decorations are out, and the entire area is so pretty this time of year.  Then on Sunday we got together for a casual photo shoot.

She mentioned to me at our book club meeting last week that she is interested in taking an introductory photography class, so I suggested that we go take photos together.  We took my doggie on a walk to the Siamese Twins rock formation, where I taught her some handy tricks regarding aperture and exposure.<!--more Some of the tricks I showed her, and other photos from our walk-->Here are the before and after photos that I took to demonstrate concepts to Brooke.  All photos are straight out of camera (not adjusted in photoshop).EXPOSUREBrooke was wearing a white shirt, which was perfect for demonstrating how the camera\\\'s auto-exposure system works.  I took this photo of her standing in direct sunlight, using the camera\\\'s fully automatic settings:<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432001884_JdDQF-O.jpg\\\">As you can see, the automatic exposure made the photo too dark.  The camera\\\'s meter assumes that each photo isn\\\'t supposed to be dark or light, instead it aims for an exposure right in the middle.  Usually that technique works just fine, but Brooke\\\'s shirt looks middle gray instead of white here.  In this situation we need to brighten the photo\\\'s exposure.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432001851_JMk8n-O.jpg\\\">Here I used the camera\\\'s P (automatic) setting again, but this time I manually adjusted the exposure to +1 stop.  Most cameras let you do this, but you might have to look in your menu options to find it.  This is a great tip for snow photos!  Have you ever noticed that snow photos often look dull and gray?  That\\\'s due to the camera\\\'s adjustment to middle gray.  You need to tell your camera that you intend for the photo to be really bright, by increasing the exposure manually.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432001834_CZ8jB-O.jpg\\\">It was convenient for our demonstration that Ally has black fur.  I took this photo fully automatically.  As you can see, the camera\\\'s auto exposure lightened her fur to middle gray.  It didn\\\'t understand that I wanted this photo to be dark.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432001820_saRTc-O.jpg\\\">This time I manually changed the exposure to -1 stop.  You can see now that her fur is black instead of gray.DEPTH OF FIELDBrooke was interested in learning about depth of field and how to control it.  Depth of field is the portion of a photo that is in focus.  For some photos, you want lots of depth of field -- for example, a landscape with flowers in the foreground, a tree in the middle ground, and mountains in the background.  For other photos, you want to draw attention to your subject with a narrow depth of field -- for example, you may want to blur the background to emphasize a flower or a portrait.Depth of field can be controlled by changing your camera\\\'s aperture.  If you set the aperture to open as wide as your lens can (say, f2.8), you will have a narrow depth of field with a blurred background.  If you close your lens down to a small aperture (say, f22), you will have great depth of field with just about everything in focus.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432004808_eNc83-O.jpg\\\">I took this photo of a branch at an aperture of f32.  Everything is in focus, which is not an asset to this photo.  The eye doesn\\\'t know what it\\\'s supposed to look at.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/432004821_t3cDW-O.jpg\\\">I took the same photo with an aperture of f4.  It\\\'s still not an interesting photo, but at least it\\\'s clear what you\\\'re supposed to look at.This is a good tip for flower photos.  Try taking a close-up photo of a flower with two very different apertures, and see which one you prefer.  I love to photograph flowers with a very blurred background.OK, here are some pictures from our outing!<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997446_P66Zp-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431998549_pegoY-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997423_WELSH-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997401_gAssG-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997376_PdUNj-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997349_2XdVK-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997280_uHxz6-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/431997260_esAY8-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:50','2008-12-07 18:11:00','Garden of the Gods with Brooke','garden-of-the-gods-with-brooke.html','/2008/12/07/',1);

Our car spun two 360s, hit the median, and then spun back into the center of the interstate, where it stopped.  Then we got hit by an oncoming pick up truck, but it was traveling very slowly without much impact to our car.  Then we were able to move the car safely to the side of the road.  Never fear, everyone is ok!  All four of us, as well as the driver of the pickup truck, are all unhurt.  The traffic was moving so slowly in the storm that we just didn\\\'t have enough speed to cause any major harm.  We were driving Mike\\\'s Cherokee (ironically, for safety), and that\\\'s pretty beat up.We ended up sitting on the side of the road for over two hours, waiting for the police to arrive and complete the necessary paperwork.  It was bitterly cold outside, with steady traffic going past. We sang John Denver songs to occupy the time and keep our nerves steady.Now all of us are home safe and sound.

I wasn\\\'t sure whether the seminars would repeat everything we\\\'d discussed in the previous two conventions, but I learned a lot last week.  The industry is constantly changing, and I need to stay ahead of the game.  I came home rejuvenated and energized for 2009.I also had great times with my photographer friends from around the world!

I went to Mexico City for the first week of January with Mike, my parents, my brother Paul, and my brother\\\'s family.  As I mentioned earlier, the trip didn\\\'t turn out quite the way we\\\'d hoped, because almost all of us came down with a flu that had swept through our family reunion the week before.  Most of our plans got canceled during our week in Mexico, including an outing to the Saturday market, a private tour of the pyramids, and Mike\\\'s birthday weekend in Cancun.  Despite all the sickness and cancellations, we still had a fantastic time with my family.  It\\\'s rare that all of us spend time together like this, so I loved even the quiet moments of reading books with the kids.We didn\\\'t get to see much of the city from beyond our car, but I did get a chance to do some drive-by shooting.<!--more More photos from Mexico City--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/447879969_j2Zmu-O.jpg\\\">I found a giant margarita the first night.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/448003879_KBvfR-O.jpg\\\">We stayed in a business district, but even there we found lots of vivid colors.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/448003903_xnS5N-O.jpg\\\">My dad and I were sitting outside at Starbucks as we watched this guy sitting on a truck, watering the plants in the median.

I\\\'m really glad several of you enjoyed the cake inspiration I posted earlier this week.  Now I thought we could chat about a color theme.Let\\\'s start with the most popular color that I\\\'ve seen over the years: red!  It\\\'s clear to me why red is so loved at weddings, because not only is it the color of romance, but it is also reflected in so many parts of the year.  Red is a great choice for weddings at Valentine\\\'s Day, Christmastime, autumn, or any time that you want a vibrant punch of color.<!--more More inspiration for red weddings--><p align=\\\"center\\\">Bouquets:<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337329533_MjsQw-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/345216108_ragkv-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/313991565_eK4CY-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/238892975-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/238893246-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/180178999-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Lynda%20and%20Dan/18.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Gabrielle%20and%20Dylan/72.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/weddings/clients/Alison%20and%20Steve/schriener25.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Decorations:<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/180178954-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/180179391-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Peggy%20and%20Joel/Ross051.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Peggy%20and%20Joel/12.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/238906042_49dNy-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/88514946_guuGQ-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/97922720_yQZuy-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Ladies:<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/238893015-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Lynda%20and%20Dan/40.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/345314907_ESsLi-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/345215943_2dEt4-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Peggy%20and%20Joel/19.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/CatherineRyan12.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Catherine%20and%20Ryan/CatherineRyan31.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/355835114_5py6k-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337163240_CcVyK-L-1.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/345314164_ZSZt6-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337203902_VRmsK-L-1.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/88434435_7u5nd-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/100474020_pzzPB-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Gentlemen:<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/313991376_65YNR-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/313991663_C6YRc-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/180179167-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://www.charlottegearyphoto.com/images/weddings/Recent%20Weddings/Gabrielle%20and%20Dylan/24.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/100386673_Tgo48-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/100386858_yLwHu-M.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:53','2009-01-28 22:33:00','Wedding Ideas: Red','wedding-ideas-red.html','/2009/1/28/',1),

I made this adorable album for my parents for Christmas.  Last year I lost a beloved cat to diabetes, and I still regret not having taken many good photos of him.  My parents\\\' cats are getting older, and I didn\\\'t want them to have the same regrets.  One day last fall I spent an afternoon doing a portrait session with their kitties while my parents were away.  Then I surprised them with this book at Christmas.Now I need to do the same for my own pets!  The cobbler\\\'s dog and cat have no shoes.<!--more More photos of this little pet album--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/444438563_iedK7-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />It\\\'s a 6\\\"x6\\\" fine art book.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/444438614_quBz9-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/444438576_RiS47-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/444438597_JsGsk-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Here are the layouts of the book:<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648955_AoXpv-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648958_CQ4hR-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648969_RNvwn-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648976_BYcoi-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648987_tsw7Z-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430648994_2AkpN-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649001_yNjNF-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649008_49jpV-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649017_VCHFh-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649018_jVFuN-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649030_GJLAu-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649035_4RqUc-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649048_CHVrK-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/430649053_q8D3F-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:53','2009-01-30 20:00:00','Cat album','cat-album.html','/2009/1/30/',1),

It\\\'s a new style of coffee table book that I saw at the photography trade show in Arizona last month.  I was looking for a more economical option for parent albums and gifts.  I really like it!  I\\\'m not a fan of traditional coffee table books, because the pinched, magazine-style binding of the pages won\\\'t open flat and end up concealing parts of the photos.  This new product has hinged pages that do open flat, and I\\\'m really impressed with the overall quality of the book.  If you\\\'re interested in learning more about these coffee table books, please drop me an email.I made this album as a sample, using photos from Meghan and Ryan\\\'s gorgeous Christmastime wedding at Donovan Pavilion in Vail.<!--more More photos and layouts from this album--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/467968038_6sevj-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"coffee table book wedding album\\\" />Here\\\'s a close-up of the hinged binding.

People often point out to me that my flash is pointed the wrong way, but actually that\\\'s the way I like to use my flash.  I bounce it off the ceiling behind me, at an angle. It creates a soft, directional light that is flattering and gives depth to the photos, <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/313991663_C6YRc-O.jpg\\\">like this</a>.<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/471989894_zSFTa-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Here I am at Keystone Ranch, taking <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337329702_DF5kC-O.jpg\\\">this photo of Jaime and Craig</a><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/471989908_Jnut3-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />And here I\\\'m taking <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337329811_w6pCM-O.jpg\\\">this photo of Jaime</a>.<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/471989921_Cufvh-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />People tell me all the time that I walk around with a huge smile on my face all day.

This photo by Holly Pacione makes me laugh!  This was very shortly before a ceremony began, and I was hurrying around in the heat, making sure that I was covering everything that was happening in multiple places at the same time.

I believe that the first bout of the evening was between Duke City Derby from New Mexico, and the Rocky Mountain Roller Girls from Denver.<!--more More photos from this roller derby bout--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814914_9UgJQ-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814905_piyEf-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814894_Nz2mB-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814899_VLH5J-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814910_2z5wg-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814890_nT2CG-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814888_WeZsB-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814885_xiQqB-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814759_8Rx5x-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814882_6LjKW-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814877_d3VKn-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814876_Uzhwr-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814872_PFzev-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/479814868_CbuZ2-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />If you\\\'d like to buy any of my photos from the tournament, you can order them here: <a href=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/gallery/7440830_8e3Qh\\\">Complete set of derby photos</a>','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:54','2009-02-24 06:40:00','Roller Derby Four Corner Feud, part 1: Duke City vs. Rocky Mountain','roller-derby-four-corner-feud-part-1-duke-city-vs.-rocky-mountain.html','/2009/2/24/',1),

Sorry about that.  This is my wedding off-season, so I\\\'ve been trying to spend more time in the beautiful weather than behind my computer.  Still I thought it would be fun to do another Wedding Ideas post.  Today\\\'s theme is the favorite color of 50% of people: Blue!  I see many shades of blue at weddings, including turquoise, periwinkle, navy, and indigo.  I also see lots of subtle touches of the color, as brides incorporate \\\"something blue\\\" into their jewelry or flowers. My own wedding had a blue and purple color scheme, so this is a particular favorite of mine!<!--more More inspiration for blue color themes--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777460_qDoQD-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777463_gEW9d-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777468_McPyo-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777473_shJDk-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777487_iBR8F-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777496_qAXkz-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777503_hShb8-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777506_X8pXi-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777512_djrBZ-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777516_isMJ6-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777523_DRTDm-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777535_MTtqK-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777538_Hr56e-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777540_ZwVsP-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777539_z47dL-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777546_jjcnY-O-2.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777563_UpYJx-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777565_cys4P-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777590_tbvD8-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777596_Ug3XE-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777602_NBi84-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777607_HioNr-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777616_3vjDP-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777626_mVTiv-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777634_N8RND-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777644_nfW4h-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777652_YJXvy-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777662_MMFCH-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777669_ZchEs-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777665_QydkL-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777676_eDxJS-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777687_mo79p-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/485777693_Ckczg-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:54','2009-03-05 22:13:00','Wedding Ideas: Blue','wedding-ideas-blue.html','/2009/3/05/',1),

Frank and I went to college together at the University of Virginia a million years ago, and were photographers together on the yearbook staff.  I always admired his photography and assumed that someday he\\\'d be a professional photographer.  Now it turns out that I\\\'m the photographer, and he\\\'s a real estate guru.  He owns a successful real estate company in Northern Virginia, and runs a popular blog: http://blog.franklyrealty.com/Frank was invited to speak at a real estate convention at the Broadmoor this weekend, so he and his lovely wife, Carrie, came out for a visit.  On Sunday the four of us went to Vail for a ski trip, and encountered 60-degree warm sunshine.  While Mike and Frank skied/snowboarded in the slush, Carrie and I dined at an outdoor restaurant in the Vail Village and then went shopping.  It was a great day!We began the weekend on Saturday, though, with a photo shoot at the Broadmoor.  Frank hired me to take some photos for his website redesign and other promotional materials.  We did some informal headshots, some goofy photos, and a few portraits of the newlyweds together.  Frank has a wacky sense of humor, and I hope these photos show that side of his personality.It was great to see you, Frank and Carrie!<!--more More photos of Frank and Carrie--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822236_Dnov7-O-3.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822226_euBYH-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822220_gdnS7-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822257_4RiKK-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822268_GtNqM-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822271_uN2uH-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Headshot portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822343_RW3aY-L.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/497822311_Uh3rE-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Portrait at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs\\\" />It\\\'s so cute that they wore matching shoes!','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:55','2009-03-24 05:35:00','Frank and Carrie: Portraits at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs','frank-and-carrie-portraits-at-the-broadmoor-in-colorado-springs.html','/2009/3/24/',1),

It was a pleasant town, but we had to imagine what it must have been like during its busier era at the turn of last century.<!--more More photos from Rocky Ford--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069857_LCrWR-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Charlotte Geary in Rocky Ford\\\" /></p><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069881_dfLG3-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford, Colorado\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069899_URamt-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford, Colorado\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069909_fj7XR-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Produce sign in Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069944_gwvYi-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Charlotte and Mike in Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069953_s27Wx-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Flying birds\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069964_sfc7A-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Flying birds\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069970_h2aXd-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Old barn in Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069980_6q8Ea-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Watch dog\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508069987_kC235-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070001_JHcG6-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford shadows\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070007_d7t8h-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford doorway\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070017_HcVcj-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford American Legion\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070034_YZhkW-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070062_pdrEm-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070072_UiEKQ-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"View from movie theater in Rocky Ford\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070085_gui9u-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford street\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070096_a3bNE-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford train station\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070105_uwqwQ-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford Heil Bean Inc\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070117_7hRpi-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford barber shop\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070147_KGxM2-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford alley\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070126_ymZP8-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford photography shop\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070132_zU2QN-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rocky Ford shop\\\" />','Published','2010-08-29 08:10:55','2009-04-08 17:51:00','Rocky Ford, Colorado','rocky-ford-colorado.html','/2009/4/08/',1),

This photo shows the hilarious Duckmaster at the <a href=\\\"http://www.peabodymemphis.com/\\\">Peabody Hotel</a> in Memphis.  The hotel has a large fountain in the lobby, where five ducks spend each day lounging.  Every evening, the Duckmaster leads them from the fountain and up an elevator to their bedroom.  Hundreds of enthusiastic tourists snap photos as the ducks stroll down the red carpet.  In other words, it\\\'s exactly the kind of wacky Americana I was hoping to encounter on this road trip.  I\\\'ve wanted to go to Dodge City, Kansas since the Grizwolds got shot at a saloon on their way to Wallyworld, but it turned out to be much less interesting than I\\\'d hoped.  I should have taken photos in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but I was too busy car-dancing.  Downtown Little Rock was a particularly fun place to walk around. We spent a couple hours exploring Memphis one afternoon. We walked around Beale Street and the neighboring areas before heading east toward Nashville. Nashville was one of the best parts of our trip; we loved the lively bars, attractive streets, and friendly atmosphere.<!--more More photos from our road trip--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070172_VTURg-O.jpg\\\">Ally, relaxing in our hotel room in Dodge City<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070182_GiceT-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070195_veyNZ-O.jpg\\\">The wild west section of Dodge City<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070217_Qvzer-O.jpg\\\">In the 1880s, there was a historic fight that occurred at the Long Branch saloon by the mayor vs the police officer.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070243_aSmnP-O.jpg\\\">I have a new appreciation for the expression \\\"get the heck out of Dodge.\\\"  We did.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070255_yFjk4-O.jpg\\\">Beale Street in Memphis<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070266_d2ueT-O.jpg\\\">Peeking in the window at the Gibson factory in Memphis<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070287_S6ADh-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070294_CCuJk-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070305_h5FEm-O.jpg\\\">The ducks in the fountain at the Peabody Hotel, with a crowd waiting to watch their procession.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070321_cmmed-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/508070343_PBA4N-O.jpg\\\">A heavy rain storm rolled in that afternoon.

PDN is a highly respected magazine for professional photographers, so it\\\'s quite an honor to be published in it. They interviewed me for an article about same sex weddings, and published three of my photos of Diana and Michaele\\\'s wedding.  I was especially happy to see my photos printed next to images by my friend Ryan Brenizer, a photographer in New York.Here\\\'s an excerpt from the article:<blockquote>Now a growing cadre of photographers, frequently driven by a strong sense of social justice, is actively marketing to gay clients. The photographers are counting on a growing acceptance of same-sex marriage around the country to help drive demand in the gay wedding industry.Among them is photographer Charlotte Geary of Manitou Springs, Colorado, who shot her first same-sex wedding for a lesbian couple in 2006.\\\"I was a little dismayed when they told me several photographers had turned them down [because] they were lesbians,\\\" Geary says. \\\"I\\\'m in the business of documenting love and relationships, and I don\\\'t feel like anyone should be denied that.\\\"Still, Geary worried about how the decision could affect her business.  Manitou Springs is a suburb of Colorado Springs, which is a socially conservative military town. But she decided to stand up for her beliefs, and treat the job like any other wedding. She posted pictures on her blog afterwards, and to her surprise, she got a flood of positive comments.\\\"Lots of people want to see a photographer who isn\\\'t afraid. People want to see love in all shapes and sizes,\\\" Geary says. \\\"After that, I realized I didn\\\'t have to be shy. Business didn\\\'t slow down at all.\\\"On the other hand, Geary\\\'s decision didn\\\'t draw a flood of same-sex wedding work, either. She shot her second gay wedding last fall, and has another booked for this year. Gay wedding jobs turn out to be sporadic, even for photographers chasing that work in the northeast, where the states that recognize gay marriage are concentrated. Clearly, same sex wedding photography is a niche in development.</blockquote>Thanks very much to PDN for including me in this article about an important topic.

The first time I photographed them, Heather was pregnant with Maggie, and I\\\'ve seen her grow from a newborn to her current four and a half years. Her brother Jack is now a tall and precocious seven year old.This time Heather had an idea that I thought was fantastic: she invited her good friend Carol and Carol\\\'s kids to have a dual family portrait session.  Carol and Heather were roommates at the University of Virginia, and now they live near each other in Reston and are the godmothers to each other\\\'s kids.  It was so much fun to photograph the friendships between the two women and all the kids.<!--more More photos of the two families--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/150720219-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Here\\\'s Maggie two years ago...<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595446_F5BXb-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />... and here she is today!<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595481_EbuFm-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Jack has grown as tall as his mother\\\'s shoulders!<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595413_LQyUC-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Almost-ten-year-old Sage and her mother Carol<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595395_7cELL-O-1.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Carol\\\'s son Peyton<img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595458_HhRoY-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595294_3Umrr-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595562_ndqPC-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><img src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/514595500_ygxbz-O.jpg\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />Someday soon Jack will be as tall as his dad.

It\\\'s a really cool place to take a family on a rainy day. <!--more More photos of our day at the museum-->(Photos taken with my Canon G10 point and shoot)<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img alt=\\\"Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum\\\" border=1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/518951908_zXoJ2-XL.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum\\\" border=1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/518951915_2cuGK-O.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum\\\" border=1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/518951894_BCQuN-O.jpg\\\">I can\\\'t believe that the only picture I took of Sarah and me is blurry!

Carla is a jazz singer-songwriter here in Colorado Springs, who is recording a new CD with her band. She envisioned photos in front of rosy sunrise, so we arrived before 6am to be there when the sun came up. Despite today\\\'s forecast for sunshine, the sky was entirely overcast and foggy, with no visible sunrise at all!Fortunately Carla was flexible, and we decided to feature the morning fog instead of the morning sunshine. I loved the soft blue mist that surrounded the trees.

It was so exciting and emotional!Sarah invited me to come to her first ultrasound, to share in the experience with her.  I asked her if I could photograph it, and she agreed.  I was thrilled when she invited me to the second and third appointments also, and I offered to photograph those as well.

I loved this moment just after Laura, the midwife, announced the baby\\\'s sex.  It took a second to sink in for Sarah, and then she starting clapping.  It took Brad a couple seconds longer for it to sink in, and then he grinned.  Meanwhile little Isaac was oblivious to the news, and was trying to put ultrasound gel in his dad\\\'s ear.

He\\\'s back in the country on R&amp;R right now, so they took a vacation to Manitou Springs over the holiday weekend.  The Garden of the Gods is one of their favorite places, so it was the perfect choice for portraits during their limited time together.

Today they are celebrating 40 years of marriage.  They got married at the end of May in Montana, and when they stepped out of the church after the ceremony, they were surprised to discover a snow storm had arrived.  You can see the dark storm clouds in this photo.  My family talks about this photo often, because there is something poetic about stepping out into a storm at the beginning of a marriage, and facing it together. Forty years later, they are still happily married and are wonderful role models for me and my brother in our own happy marriages.I hope there aren\\\'t any storm clouds for them today, because they are celebrating their 40th anniversary with friends at the beach.  Mom and Dad, I wish we could be there, too!  But we\\\'ll see you very soon.  Happy anniversary!

We love San Francisco ordinarily, but over the weekend the city was even more delightful than usual, with perfect spring weather. Mae and Robby got married at St. Ignatius Church, a gorgeous Catholic Church at the University of San Francisco. Their reception took place at the Cliff House, a restaurant that sits right on a cliff overlooking the Pacific.  The entire wedding day couldn\\\'t have been more beautiful.Congratulations, Mae and Robby!

I had no idea where I was headed, but that was part of the fun.  Unfortunately my favorite road trip buddy couldn\\\'t join me, because Mike was out of town, but my dog Ally made for a great companion.  We headed west on Hwy 50, and five hours later ended up in Gunnison, Colorado.  By this time I was tired of driving and not looking forward to driving home in the dark.  I decided to stay for the night, which turned my random road trip into a spontaneous mini-vacation.

It was my first day shooting with my new Canon 5D Mark II camera, so I was excited to have a chance to try it out. This camera is known for its ability to perform beautifully at high ISO, which really suits my preference for natural light photography. The church and reception venue yesterday were both quite dark, so I photographed much of the day at ISO 4000.  The results are excellent, and I\\\'m really happy with my new camera.One of my favorite things about second shooting is the freedom to take lots of pictures of the children at weddings. When I\\\'m the primary shooter, I don\\\'t have much time to play with the kiddos, but yesterday I made sure to take lots of pictures of the many cuties in attendance.Thanks, Brad, for asking me to shoot with you!<!--more More photos of their wedding--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride getting ready at the Westin Westminster\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589205975_qryMB-O.jpg\\\">Keeley and the ladies got ready at the Westin Hotel in Westminster.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride getting ready at the Westin Westminster\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589205998_EALU5-O.jpg\\\">Keeley\\\'s room had a beautiful view of the mountains.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride getting ready at the Westin Westminster\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206006_xZ7FR-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206015_Fm2m7-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride getting her make-up done\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206020_Q2qb2-O.jpg\\\">Keeley has gorgeous turquoise eyes.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589205984_nHyb6-O.jpg\\\">Here\\\'s Brad Walters<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Groom with white boutonniere\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206024_cijXs-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Groom with groomsmen in black suits and black shirts\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206033_izY9u-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206060_8xDUs-O.jpg\\\">Looking fabulous is a tiring process.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Flower girl and her father\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206047_QLH7C-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride getting ready with bridesmaids\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206086_UTRPH-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bridesmaid with champagne\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206067_Jdeo9-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Mother of the groom and mother of the bride\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206081_t3NTF-O.jpg\\\">Adam\\\'s mother and Keeley\\\'s mother have become great friends.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Father of the bride seeing her before the ceremony\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/589206119_Pwagd-O.jpg\\\">I loved Keeley\\\'s father\\\'s reaction when he saw her before the ceremony.

I made that change on August 1, 1999, after volunteering with <a href=\\\"http://www.cwu.edu/~cwuchci/\\\">chimpanzees that speak sign language</a>. After speaking with a non-human animal in a shared language, and getting a glimpse into their thoughts and feelings, I started to see all animals differently.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that I wanted to go vegetarian.  I feel great about this lifestyle, and its impact on my health, my conscience, and the environment. Today I celebrated my anniversary with a trip to the Old Colorado City farmers market, where I picked up all these goodies.  I don\\\'t know what to eat first!  (Edited to add: I decided to make grilled veggie wraps for lunch. I marinated red peppers, carrots, and Mexican squash in some balsamic vinegar, and then grilled them on the Foreman. I wrapped them in whole wheat tortillas with spinach, cabbage, and goat cheese. Nice!)','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:00','2009-08-01 18:20:00','A decade of vegetarianism','a-decade-of-vegetarianism.html','/2009/8/01/',1),

Looking back on their wedding day, they wished that they\\\'d had a chance to take more portraits of the two of them.  Finally they decided to get dressed up in their wedding attire and have the photo shoot they\\\'d been wishing for.  They asked me to take some photos of them in front of Shove Chapel, and then we headed to the Garden of the Gods for some great Colorado landscapes.It was wonderful to have so much time with a bride and groom!  I highly recommend post-wedding portrait sessions to any couple who would like a great variety of beautiful photos together.  A wedding day is usually structured under a tight schedule, so this kind of portrait session is relaxed and freeing.<!--more More of their portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Shove Chapel wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992804_NUKE2-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Shove Chapel weddings in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992799_i3xSD-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Shove Chapel weddings in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992794_qcyiY-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992778_Un6vt-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992754_E8rhd-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992747_WY8ft-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992742_F44ZU-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods wedding in Colorado Springs\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992735_57oD5-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:00','2009-08-16 11:53:00','Melanie and Matt: Wedding portraits at Shove Chapel and the Garden of the Gods','melanie-and-matt-wedding-portraits-at-shove-chapel-and-the-garden-of-the-gods.html','/2009/8/16/',1),

They got married at Keystone Ranch, a mountain lodge and luxury golf course. As you can see, the Ranch has incredible scenery, with a lake, rolling hills, and mountain views. Sarah and Nathan included Nathan\\\'s two children in every step of the day, and they even had Sarah\\\'s border collie at the wedding. I don\\\'t even need to say that I loved this wedding -- an event with children, dogs, a beautiful setting, and a laid-back couple in love is my kind of perfect day.<!--more More photos from their

I\\\'ll be thinking about you for years to come, and I\\\'m grateful for the opportunity to meet you and learn from your appreciation for life.  <!--more More of their portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550109_zapUe-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550097_KvKui-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550088_CJzQC-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550078_RwLoe-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550062_KUq8u-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550132_mXSyo-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550075_g3Ajd-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550028_jmsXj-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550025_GH3jB-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550009_cvn83-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643550069_kLCBz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643549997_j2dja-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643549983_VWMBV-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:01','2009-09-09 03:22:00','Colorado Springs family portraits: Jim, Barbara, Linda, and Eric','colorado-springs-family-portraits-jim-barbara-linda-and-eric.html','/2009/9/09/',1),

They are all sitting on a hard drive in untouched raw format.  I\\\'ve decided to start processing them in small batches when my time permits, so I\\\'ll probably be posting them here in random order as I finish. Here\\\'s our afternoon being tourists at South Park City in Fairplay.  It\\\'s a restored old mining town that we drive past every time we head into the ski resort areas.  One day Mike and I decided to stop and check it out.  We had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be an impressive and thorough museum that was a lot of fun to photograph.<!--more More photos from South Park--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Father Dyer Chapel in South Park City\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521188_rhQeb-O-1.jpg\\\">Father Dyer Chapel<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521193_hgiYN-O.jpg\\\">Carpenter/morgue<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521250_td3XC-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521251_gr2iC-O.jpg\\\">A mining shack<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521291_zJd3w-O.jpg\\\">Huge mining equipment<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"One room schoolhouse\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521300_QBTxR-O.jpg\\\">The one-room schoolhouse<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"One room schoolhouse\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521414_26Nri-O.jpg\\\">Inside the schoolhouse<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521309_JTief-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521438_nwxj4-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521465_zFEZH-O.jpg\\\">The stairs leading to the Masonic temple<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521394_Ue3uX-O-1.jpg\\\">Inside a family home<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"South Park City in Fairplay Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521382_8eMKk-O-1.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/643521443_e3hPH-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:01','2009-09-10 15:59:00','South Park City','south-park-city.html','/2009/9/10/',1),

I work in many of them, and they are a unique aspect of Colorado style. Unfortunately they can make skin look Oompa Loopa orange if you\\\'re not careful with your lighting.  Do you want to know my secret?  For the last several months, I\\\'ve been using <a href=\\\"http://www.profusion-flash-diffuser.com\\\">Profusion flash diffusers</a>.  The Profusion was invented by my friend Brad Walters, so his team let me try them out before they were available to the public.  I\\\'m glad they did, because I needed them several times over the summer!The Profusion is a white bounce card with folding barn doors to enable you to control the strength and direction of the light.  It scatters the light softly, and is a great help for situations where there is no ceiling or walls for bouncing. The diffuser folds away from my flash when I\\\'d prefer to bounce or use it directly. It also folds flat to fit easily in my bag.  I have three of them, and often use two on off-camera flashes, and one on-camera.They used several of my photos as examples on the site, so go take a peek: <a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2009/09/14/product-recommendation-profusion-flash-diffuser/\\\">http://www.profusion-flash-diffuser.com</a><!--more More examples with the Profusion--><img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/572297378_8z9FU-O.jpg\\\">Here\\\'s another log cabin wedding, again with two off-camera flashes with Profusions, and one on my camera. I didn\\\'t have to do anything to correct the white balance, despite all the brown and orange surfaces around the bride and groom.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/640219355_9K5ao-O.jpg\\\">This venue is really dark, with no white surfaces for bouncing flash.  The entire room is red brick and black metal, with a 50-foot ceiling. In this picture, you can see my two off-camera flashes in the background, each with a Profusion. I also used a Profusion on my on-camera flash. Look how well the light is distributed around the room, and the perfect white balance on Nikki\\\'s gown.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/611497513_jgSEd-O.jpg\\\">Here\\\'s a different wedding at the same venue. This room is dark, but two off-camera flashes with Profusions were able to light up the whole place while keeping the ambiance of the room.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/611497577_tSGT9-O.jpg\\\">During the toasts, I used the two off-camera flashes and added an on-camera flash with a Profusion.

My good friends Sarah and <a href=\\\"http://www.bradwaltersphoto.com\\\">Brad Walters</a> invited me to photograph the birth of their daughter.  I was deeply honored to have been asked.  When I got the call early Tuesday morning, I rushed to their home to document the stages of labor and the delivery.  I had never seen a birth before, and it was a profoundly beautiful and emotional experience to witness.Baby Naomi was born at her family\\\'s home, in a water birth that was assisted by Laura Luckett of <a href=\\\"http://www.babysbreathmidwifery.com/home/\\\">Baby\\\'s Breath Midwifery</a> and her assistant, Dana. Sarah chose not to use pain medicine, instead opting for the comfort of a pool of water. Brad comforted her throughout her labor, and monitored her contractions with the help of an iPhone app.  Sarah and Brad\\\'s parents were there for support and to take care of almost-two-year-old big brother Isaac. I observed quietly and documented events as they occurred around me.  I have been documenting Sarah\\\'s pregnancy since her first ultrasound.  You can see my previous photos here:<a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2009/03/02/sarahs-new-baby-2/\\\">First ultrasound</a><a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2009/04/28/sarahs-second-ultrasound/\\\">Second ultrasound</a><a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2009/05/21/sarahs-third-ultrasound/\\\">Third ultrasound</a>I am grateful to Sarah and Brad for inviting me into such a private moment, and for introducing me to the miracles of childbirth.  I would love to be able to photograph more births in the future, so if you or someone you know would be interested, please let me know.  I present these photos here on my blog with permission from Sarah. I will let the photos speak for themselves.For the complete story, view their slideshow:<object type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"470\\\" id=\\\"showit_swf\\\" data=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/slideshows/NaomiBirth/showit.swf\\\"><param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/slideshows/NaomiBirth/showit.swf\\\" /><param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"showit_embed=http://www.charlottegeary.com/slideshows/NaomiBirth/|700|470|1|1|0\\\" /><param name=\\\"wmode\\\" value=\\\"transparent\\\" /><param name=\\\"salign\\\" value=\\\"LT\\\" /><param name=\\\"menu\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" /><param name=\\\"loop\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" /><param name=\\\"quality\\\" value=\\\"best\\\" /><param name=\\\"bgcolor\\\" value=\\\"#FFFFFF\\\" /></object><!--more More photos from Naomi\\\'s birth--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312603_fv8YY-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312613_kng8V-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312620_7E8RN-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312627_8LwXH-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312631_gYE9y-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312639_f5Ddq-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312647_wq7H3-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312655_vt9Dt-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312663_og8jH-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312670_8Syzb-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312689_EmHtz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312690_aC4fc-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312694_bvSct-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312698_XboHm-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312701_hN9Nm-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312712_G6CZb-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312719_Xeq9U-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312723_CSGDW-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312727_X4HK5-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312736_PpmdD-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312744_wKBjd-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312755_a789b-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312761_2isc2-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312771_BTcWY-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312781_vidaf-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312791_EisNu-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312808_KBnBk-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312813_MPtkP-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312818_bKvMo-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312835_KnukV-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312843_6NomF-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312856_gaDzv-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312865_cVa8R-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/676312876_Uttpn-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:02','2009-10-10 23:44:00','Birth photography: The birth of Naomi Walters','birth-photography-the-birth-of-naomi-walters.html','/2009/10/10/',1),

They asked me to photograph their first anniversary portraits, and got all dressed up in their wedding attire for the occasion.  Because Tara wouldn\\\'t need to wear the gown again, we didn\\\'t have to worry about getting it dirty or wet, which gave us lots of opportunities for great photos.  They lay in the grass at the Garden of the Gods Club, went hiking at Rainbow Falls in Manitou, and rolled around in the sand at the waterfall.  Tara was even brave enough to stand in the freezing cold water for some pictures!  The popular name for this kind of portrait shoot is a trash the dress session. I prefer to call it a fearless bridal session, because my goal is not to destroy a gown, it\\\'s to showcase a bride who isn\\\'t afraid of getting a little dirty.  The results are liberating and so much fun!<!--more More of their anniversary portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297878_Ckj6f-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297869_GZjAu-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297860_8kJEP-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297834_uH7VW-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297833_8fi7t-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297827_zYajV-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297818_eRiH6-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297807_G9cht-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297800_JD6pV-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297792_SX9Zb-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297775_vAbUD-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297767_pcEfK-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Garden of the Gods Club wedding by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297761_f2ZbP-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls wedding portrait by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297755_QrgCt-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls wedding portrait by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297750_Jt8iS-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls trash the dress photos by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297735_3ChEn-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls trash the dress photos by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297728_Eozzn-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls trash the dress photos by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297717_BkTFd-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls trash the dress photos by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297710_pjUC4-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Rainbow Falls trash the dress photos by Charlotte Geary Photography\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/687297700_rgCMQ-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:02','2009-10-20 20:41:00','Garden of the Gods Club wedding portraits: Tara and Bryan','garden-of-the-gods-club-wedding-portraits-tara-and-bryan.html','/2009/10/20/',1),

Her parents live here in CO Springs, and she and her siblings are in town for Thanksgiving weekend.  The four siblings surprised their parents with a family portrait session from me as an early Christmas present.  It\\\'s always a great compliment to be hired by a fellow photographer, and I particularly loved getting to know Kari and her family.  As you\\\'ll see, they love to laugh and have a good time.  Thanks so much, Kari!  You guys are awesome.If any of you would like to give a portrait session as a Christmas present, please contact me at charlotte@charlottegeary.com.  I have gift certificates available for portrait sessions, albums, and prints. You can also apply my gift certificates to wedding photography, so if you know anyone getting married next year, consider giving them a photography gift certificate.<!--more More of their family portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372876_orGkf-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait photographer\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372893_gVVGE-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372928_n9gwn-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Portraits in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372921_VGyUa-O.jpg\\\">Kari and her husband Mark -- these adorable newlyweds just got married last month!<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372940_YXSv3-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Portraits at the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372953_k6Lq9-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372971_dpux2-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372982_FnpoD-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727372996_LB3hF-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373021_wkZkx-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373045_h97t7-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373055_RRv5C-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373077_pxH55-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373088_RpPtz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373133_m2dDn-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373152_nySHy-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado Springs family portrait in the Garden of the Gods\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/727373175_EcvYY-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:03','2009-11-30 02:04:00','Colorado Springs family portraits in the Garden of the Gods','colorado-springs-family-portraits-in-the-garden-of-the-gods.html','/2009/11/30/',1),

I\\\'ll help as best as I can.  :)<!--more Questions and answers about camera equipment--><ul><li><b>Sarahrah asked about my favorite, most versatile equipment.</b>Camera bodies: I shoot with Canon 5D cameras.  My favorite camera is the Canon 5DMkII, which works beautifully at high ISO.  I\\\'m often faced with low-light situations, such as dark churches or sunset portraits.  Lenses: I shoot with many lenses; I constantly change lenses throughout each shoot. My lenses are all Canon, ranging in focal length from 15mm-200mm.  My favorite lens is the Canon 135mm f2L, and the Canon 16-35mm f2L is in second place.  I love to shoot wide angle and telephoto.  My favorite lenses actually aren\\\'t my most versatile. My versatile lens is the 24-70mm f2.8L, which offers a safe, multi-purpose range of focal lengths and a fast enough aperture for most situations. I use this lens often for group portraits, wedding processions, and other situations where I need a safe shot.  I don\\\'t like to use it for situations where I want to be creative, because I prefer to use more extreme focal lengths (either wide or long) whenever I can.</li><li><b>Holly Coffel is looking for a point-and-shoot camera under $200 that doesn\\\'t have much of a shutter lag between the time she pushes the button and it actually takes the picture.  </b>I feel your pain, Holly!  I get so frustrated with point-and-shoots for this very reason.  They are great for posed pictures or landscapes, but really tough for moving objects.  Children are especially tough to capture when there\\\'s shutter lag.  I use a Canon G10 as my purse camera, but it\\\'s an expensive option.  I\\\'m not personally familiar with other cameras, but I found a site that compares cameras\\\' shutter lags: <a href=\\\"http://www.cameras.co.uk/html/shutter-lag-comparisons.cfm\\\">http://www.cameras.co.uk/html/shutter-lag-comparisons.cfm</a></li><li><b>Oh_so_luscious wants opinions on the Canon Rebel XSI.</b>Unfortunately I haven\\\'t tried this camera myself, but I think the Canon Rebel series is a great choice for people looking for a more affordable SRL.  My first SLR was a Rebel (a film one back in 1990), and it was a great way for me to learn the different manual features gradually.  I highly recommend that Rebel owners experiment with shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, rather than keeping it in fully automatic mode.For most people, the Rebel is plenty sufficient. As a professional, I wouldn\\\'t use one.  I prefer the vibrant, low-noise sensor of more professional cameras, such as the 50D or the 5D.  Image quality is superior with those cameras.It\\\'s important to note, though, that the lens has a huge impact on the quality of a photograph.  When in doubt, invest your money in the best lenses you can afford. </li><li><b>I_za asked about the lighting systems I use, and whether I use additional light only when there\\\'s not enough natural light available.</b>I use additional light sources not when there isn\\\'t *enough* available light, but when I don\\\'t like the *quality* of the available light.  I pay constant attention to the quality of the light around me, whether it\\\'s sunlight or room lights.  I examine the direction of the light, the intensity of the shadows, the color temperature, and the general aesthetics of the light.  If I like what I see, I shoot without any flash or other additional light sources.  I\\\'d estimate that 90% of my family/engagement portraits are shot with natural light only.  At weddings, the conditions vary so much that I can\\\'t really estimate -- maybe 40% natural light on average.If I choose to add light to a scene, I have a variety of techniques that I use, depending on the situation.  I often bounce flash off walls (to the side) or the ceiling (behind me at an angle).  I use off-camera flashes in rooms where there are no good surfaces for bouncing. I occasionally use direct fill flash outdoors, dialed down in intensity and balanced with the ambient light so that there is no deer-in-the-headlights flash look.  I also love reflectors and video lights on occasion.In summary, I\\\'m not a purist of any lighting technique.  I consider it my job as a professional to be able to handle any situation and use the light that is most appropriate at the time.</li><li><b>I_za asked if I always have an assistant to help with lighting.</b>I usually bring an assistant and/or second shooter to weddings, but I shoot almost all my portrait sessions solo. At weddings, my assistant assembles off-camera lighting and holds reflectors or video lights, among other duties.  During portrait sessions, I have much more control over the location and timing of each shoot, so I don\\\'t usually need lighting assistance.  I choose locations and compositions that have nice natural light.</li><li><b>I_za asked how I carry my equipment while shooting. </b> I use a <a href=\\\"http://www.shootsac.com\\\">Shootsac</a> lens bag while shooting.  It stores three lenses, as well as my CF cards, batteries, car keys, business cards, and lip gloss.  I keep my backup equipment locked in my car trunk.  I_za, if you can\\\'t buy a Shootsac where you\\\'re from, you should check into <a href=\\\"http://www.goboda.com/main.html\\\">Boda bags</a> and see if you can order those.  Some of my colleagues use the Boda and love it.  </li><li><b>Thekerriproject is worried about chromatic aberration (purple fringe) in her pictures, and how to reduce it.  </b>I sympathize, Kerri!  I get this problem occasionally, too, because I like to shoot with my lens wide open.  The problem is that the different colors aren\\\'t focusing on the same plane, so if you have a smaller aperture and more depth of field, the colors will all focus better.  I reduce it in Lightroom, using the chromatic aberration sliders.  It doesn\\\'t always work as well as I\\\'d like, so I\\\'ve been known to open JPEGs in Photoshop and edit each pixel carefully.  Ugh.</li><li><b>Inthespaces wants video lights for the holidays, and asks what I use.</b>Great present choice!  I use Sunpak video lights that I got from Amazon: <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/SunPak-55-RL-Sunpak-Video-Light/dp/B000816CH6\\\">http://www.amazon.com/SunPak-55-RL-Sunpak-Video-Light/dp/B000816CH6</a>.  Buy two of them if you can. :)</li><li><b>Inthespaces also asked for a recommendation for a shutter release for the Canon 30D.</b>Unfortunately I don\\\'t have any experience with that, sorry!  Does anyone reading this have a recommendation?</li><li><b>Desert_sparrow asked whether I clean my own sensor.</b>Before every shoot, I clean my sensors manually with a <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Giottos-AA1900-Large-Rocket-Blaster/dp/B00017LSPI\\\">Rocket blower</a>.  Once a year, I send my cameras to Canon to be professionally cleaned.  My Canon 5DMkII has a self-cleaning sensor that cleans itself whenever I turn off the camera, so that is a great help.</ul>I hope this has been helpful!  I will respond to everyone as soon as I can.

	(721,1,'Over the years, many people have asked me how to start out as a wedding photographer. Wedding photography is creative, exciting, and rewarding, but it\\\'s also hard work that requires dedicated preparation. I made so many mistakes when I was starting out!  I hope I can help you learn from my experience. Here are the steps I recommend as you start a photography business. <h2>1.  Learn the Basics of Photography</h2>Before you involve any other people in your photography career, you must know your camera. Devote time to photography classes, books, and websites.  Join online forums. Read your camera manual, as many times as needed. Learn how and when to use a flash and other lighting. Learn photo editing software, such as Photoshop and Lightroom.  Make sure you understand concepts like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, depth of field, focal length, underexposure, overexposure, and the rule of thirds. Relying on your camera\\\'s automatic functions is not sufficient, even if you are confident in your artistic eye.  The truth is that lots of people have a good eye -- that\\\'s not enough to be a professional photographer.It is your own responsibility to learn these basics.  Do not expect other photographers to teach you what you need to know.  It is especially important that you do not use paying clients or real weddings as an opportunity to practice your skills.  Respect weddings and clients. Learn the basics before you involve anyone else.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>I took photography classes in high school, college, and graduate school. It took me a while into my studies before I really started to grasp the different concepts and trust my manual settings. In the years since, I have become a much better photographer through practice and self-teaching. I have continued my education through photography workshops, seminars, and conventions.  I read photography magazines and books.  I participate regularly in online photography forums (my favorite is the <a href=\\\"http://www.digitalweddingforum.com\\\">Digital Wedding Forum</a>).</blockquote><br><h2>2. Purchase Equipment Gradually</h2>After you have a good foundation in the basics of photography, you will understand the benefits of different types of equipment.  You do not want to invest much money into your gear until you know how to choose between all the different features available. For example, you need to understand aperture before choosing a lens.I also recommend that you develop your own shooting style before purchasing lenses and lighting. You might discover that you love to shoot wide angle, or perhaps telephoto is more your style. If you like shooting with natural light, you\\\'ll want a camera body with high ISO capability and lenses with large apertures. If you prefer the look of off-camera lighting, you\\\'ll need to purchase lighting gear.  Don\\\'t spend too much until you know your own style.Later, when you are ready to shoot weddings, you will need to have at least this bare minimum of required equipment: two camera bodies, two lenses, two flashes, CF cards, batteries, a computer system, and photo editing software. You will probably find that you need a lot more than this minimal list. Backup gear is essential.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>I kept out of debt by purchasing items only when I had the money for them.  I waited to buy anything until I was certain which items I\\\'d need to achieve my photographic vision. I continue to purchase gear gradually, updating an item only when I need it.  I don\\\'t buy the best gear -- I buy the gear that best suits my artistic goals and financial plans.</blockquote><br><h2>3. Start a Portfolio by Photographing Your Friends </h2>Practice on people who won\\\'t mind that you are still learning.  Take free portraits of your family, friends, and pets.  Shoot in a variety of settings, including bright sun, shade, tungsten lighting, and darkness. Become competent and consistent with lighting, posing, and exposure.  You need to practice often enough that the camera settings are almost intuitive. Later when you are at weddings, if you spend time pondering your settings, you will miss important moments that you should be photographing. You should be able to adjust your camera while paying attention to the people you are photographing.  This is not an easy task, but you will be doing clients a great disservice if you pay more attention to your camera than to them.  Now is your time to practice.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>I took free portraits of tons of family and friends.  It was excellent practice. Eventually I got work requests from people who had seen my portraits and trusted me to do the same for them.  When I starting considering collecting payment, I needed to formally establish a business.</blockquote><br><h2>4. Establish the Formalities of Your Business </h2>I am by no means an expert on business development, so you will want professional guidance for these very important steps.  Consult your lawyer, accountant, and local government offices for help.  You may want to find a volunteer at your local <a href=\\\"http://www.score.org\\\">SCORE</a> to help you.  - Write a business plan (<a href=\\\"http://www.strategyavenue.com\\\">Strategy Avenue</a>  offers a helpful template.)- Choose a business name - Apply for an employer identification number (EIN), which is your federal tax ID (through <a href=\\\"http://www.irs.gov\\\">the IRS</a>)- Register to collect sales tax (through your state)- Work with an accountant to establish your business as a sole proprietor, LLC, or corporation- Open business bank account and credit card- Work with a lawyer to write a contract (<a href=\\\"http://photographerstoolkit.com\\\">Photographer\\\'s Toolkit</a> is a great starting point.)- Obtain insurance for liability and equipment (Any major insurance company can help.)- Create a logo, website, business cards, and other aspects of brand identity- Join the Professional Photographers of America for professional and legal support (<a href=\\\"http://www.ppa.com\\\">PPA</a>)- File all required taxes when appropriate<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>In a state of confusion.  I wish I had known about <a href=\\\"http://www.score.org\\\">SCORE</a> when I was starting out. There is little room for error, so get help where you need it.</blockquote><br><h2>5. Assist Other Photographers</h2>Now is the time to learn how to apply your photography skills to the high-pressure, rapidly changing environment of a wedding. But first you need to get to know other photographers. Network with local photographers whose work you admire. Attend networking events. Get to know them on online forums. Invite them out to lunch.I get frequent email from novice photographers who want to work with me at weddings. I can\\\'t risk taking an inexperienced photographer to a wedding, especially someone I don\\\'t know. My clients\\\' wedding day is not the place for me to teach a class, and I must know and trust anyone that I bring into a wedding.  If you want to work with another photographer, first get to know him or her well enough to reveal that you are trustworthy, hardworking, and passionate.  Don\\\'t ask that person to be your teacher, especially not during a wedding.  Your job as an assistant will be to help that photographer, not to receive help. Show a genuine desire to help that photographer do his or her job. Observe the photographer\\\'s methods as you assist, and you will learn tons of valuable information.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>With a couple exceptions, I skipped this step and suffered as a result. I would have been so much better in my early days if I had worked for someone else first.</blockquote><br><h2>6. Photograph a Few Free Weddings as Primary Photographer </h2>When you are skilled in photography, established as a business, and comfortable with the flow of weddings, you could be ready to take on your own clients.  I recommend that you photograph a few free weddings as a way to build your portfolio. Once you have a strong portfolio, you can enter the market at a higher price.  On the other hand, if you don\\\'t have a strong portfolio, you\\\'ll need to charge very low rates to get any work. If you start off at a low rate, it\\\'s more difficult to raise your prices over time and keep a word of mouth referral base. <blockquote><i>How I did it</i>I photographed a few friends\\\' weddings free or at cost. Even though I wasn\\\'t getting paid, I did not consider their weddings to be my practice ground. I worked hard and gave the respect that every wedding deserves. My portfolio grew, and so did my experience as a primary photographer.</blockquote><br><h2>7.  Determine Your Pricing</h2>Put together a pricing structure for your services and products. Part of this process happens when you create a business plan, but now is the time for the specifics. Consider the pricing of other photographers in your region, but don\\\'t base your pricing entirely on that. Evaluate the costs of your products, equipment, marketing, insurance, taxes, education, rent, bills, transportation, and everything else. Decide how many hours you want to work, and how much money you want to make as profit. Then decide how much you need to charge.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>With spreadsheets, calculators, receipts, speculation, goals, and patience.  I revise my pricing every six months, as my costs and services change.</blockquote><br><h2>8. Market to Paying Clients </h2>There are tons of strategies for marketing, and you will need to devise a plan that will reach your target clients.  Determine who your target market is and how to be accessible to them.  You may need to read books and take classes to learn how to create a marketing plan.<blockquote><i>How I did it</i>My first clients were word-of-mouth referrals by the friends and family I had photographed.  My blog was a great way to find new clients in my early days, and it continues to be my strongest marketing tool.  Networking has been important, too; I\\\'ve made friends with other photographers in my area, who now like me enough to refer brides to me on dates that they are booked. I also network with other wedding vendors, such as venues, coordinators, florists, and DJs. I have done very little paid internet advertising throughout my career, and no print advertising. I\\\'ve read several marketing books and websites to guide me along the way.</blockquote><br><h2>9. Continue Learning, Adapting, and Enjoying</h2>This industry moves quickly, and every day is a new adventure.  I hope you\\\'ll enjoy it as much as I have.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/620992725_5GkDu-O.jpg\\\">','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:04','2009-12-06 07:46:00','How to Become a Wedding Photographer','how-to-become-a-wedding-photographer.html','/2009/12/06/',1),

	(732,1,'Here we are on the first day of a new decade, wondering where the last one went. It doesn\\\'t seem as though ten years have gone by since we greeted a new millennium with fanfare, paranoia, and Robbie Williams songs. The decade ended much more quietly than it began, which parallels the peaceful contentment I\\\'ve discovered during the same time period.  I started the millennium as an enthusiastic twenty-five-year-old who was confused about careers and relationships. Ten years later, I\\\'m happily settled with the love of my life, in a house of our own, with my own successful business.  Allow me the indulgence of celebrating the last ten years of my life.<!--more Looking back on my last ten years--><h2>2000</h2>At the beginning of the decade, I was 25 years old and a graduate student at the University of Virginia.  I was living solo for the first time in my life, in an adorable apartment in Charlottesville. My companions were eight-month-old kittens named Janie and Roger. I was one semester into a graduate program in Instructional Technology.  I had a fellowship to cover my PhD tuition, but I had recently decided not to pursue a PhD, and to stop at the Masters level instead. A life in academia wasn\\\'t for me.That summer I spent a month on a cross-country road trip with my parents. We visited almost all of my extended family on both sides, and spent a couple weeks in Colorado.  I would never have predicted that four years later I\\\'d be living there.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615710_tAMso-O.jpg\\\">Our road trip: With my parents in Glacier National Park, and hiking in Chaco Canyon, CO. Forgive the image quality from these scanned film prints.  I\\\'m glad I discovered digital cameras three years later.<h2>2001</h2>In 2001, I got my masters degree in Instructional Technology and moved to Arlington, Virginia. I was living with a roommate in the Courthouse/Clarendon area, and falling in love with the constant energy of city life. <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615716_XfX2y-O.jpg\\\">My graduation ceremony. It was the second time I\\\'d walked the UVA Lawn in a cap and gown. My parents, brother, and sister-in-law were there to cheer me on.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615724_NGEpJ-O.jpg\\\">I got a job as an instructional designer at <a href=\\\"http://k12.com/\\\">K12</a> in McLean, Virginia. I developed educational software for children, specializing in phonics and language arts. I met some wonderful friends and really loved this job. I spent the summer of 2001 working insane hours as we prepared for the launch of the product in September. I didn\\\'t care about the long hours; I loved the work and my colleagues.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615730_rFj8C-O.jpg\\\">On September 11th, I watched the smoke from the Pentagon from my apartment window. Emergency vehicles screamed past my apartment all day. I ushered my cats into their carriers, packed my most important belongings, and prepared to evacuate if necessary. Like most of the world, I couldn\\\'t turn away from the news.  I took time off from work that week to volunteer at the Pentagon family assistance center, where I worked in the call center to help people locate missing family members.  Someone had donated this American flag cake for the volunteers.  I wasn\\\'t sure if I should smile for the photo -- this image makes me feel uncomfortable when I look at it.I spent a lot of time walking through Arlington and DC, taking photographs of candlelight vigils and the grief that was everywhere.  Over the following weeks, the community grief managed to transform into patriotism and hope as American flags appeared all over town. Someday I will scan in the photos I took during those months, to share them here.  <h2>2002</h2>2002 was much less eventful for me. It was my year of weight loss.  I spent most of my time working out, eating egg whites, and looking cute. In some ways it was an excellent year, and in other ways it was tediously dull.  I loved being thin, but I never want to waste another year in a gym.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615737_ybXS7-O.jpg\\\"><h2>2003</h2>This year turned out to be one of the greatest of my life. <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615745_F2N4X-O.jpg\\\">I had been single for a few years, and I got tired of collecting unused vacation time while waiting for someone to travel with.  In early August, I packed my camera and took a solo vacation for the first time. I went to San Francisco, where I spent my time doing only the things I wanted to do. I felt strong, independent, and truly happy. I finally accepted the fact that I didn\\\'t need a man to be happy, nor did I particularly want one. I would never have guessed that my single life was about to end forever.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615752_s5hbN-O.jpg\\\">On August 8, 2003, a day after I returned from San Francisco, I became an aunt. My brother and his wife brought beautiful Kenna into my life, and in the years to come she would be joined by her two brothers. Loving those children has been a highlight of my life ever since.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615764_xMgZB-O.jpg\\\">On August 11, 2003, I started a new job in Maryland. The first person that I met on my first day at work was a cute engineer with an English accent. He had just returned from a trip to Australia, and instantly I was drawn to his interest in travel and photography and his cheerful sense of humor. I tried very hard to think of him only as a professional colleague. Six weeks later, Mike and I were a couple. In late October he told me that he loved me.  In November we went on vacation to Colorado Springs.  In December he took me to England to meet his parents. Life changed very quickly.  I couldn\\\'t stop smiling.<h2>2004</h2>Life changed even more in 2004.  In March, I quit my job to pursue photography full time. I had been photographing a few weddings each year, but Mike encouraged me to follow my passion. I\\\'m still very grateful to him for that. Then life changed even more.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615771_L9NVn-O.jpg\\\">In April, Mike and I went on a vacation with my parents to Santorini, Greece. It was perhaps the most beautiful and romantic place we\\\'d ever seen. The time was right. Mike asked me to marry him.  We were so happy.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615783_XJFEt-O.jpg\\\">That summer, Mike was offered a job at a robotics engineering firm in Colorado Springs. We figured that Colorado would be a more affordable place than DC for me to start my own business, and we liked the idea of an adventurous life in the Rocky Mountains. Eleven months after we started dating, we bought a house in Colorado and our Wild West adventures began.<h2>2005</h2>It was the year we got married.  I will be celebrating the year 2005 for the rest of my life.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615811_KeUSq-O.jpg\\\">In January we met a sweet Aussie shepherd mix at the Colorado Springs Humane Society. We both loved her instantly. She had been in the animal shelter for several months and wouldn\\\'t be allowed to stay much longer -- our timing was perfect to save her precious life. Ally came home with us and has given and received constant love ever since. <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615800_dub9J-O.jpg\\\">On July 30, 2005, Mike and I stood in front of our friends and family and promised our lives to each other. We got married in his beautiful home town of Wells, Somerset, England. Our wedding day was nothing I\\\'d expected but everything I ever wanted. I still look back on it as the best day of my life. <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615809_9a5rQ-O.jpg\\\">We honeymooned in Italy. We spent two weeks in Venice, Milan, Pisa, Cinque Terra, Florence, and Rome. We ate too much, spent too much, and smiled a lot. I can\\\'t wait to take another vacation like that.<h2>2006</h2>Life finally started to settle into place in 2006.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615820_xhjxj-O.jpg\\\">In the spring time, we took another trip to Greece with my parents. This time we explored the mainland, including Athens and Delphi.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615827_YdicQ-O.jpg\\\">That summer was a great success for my photography business, with a full schedule of weddings and portraits, and a series of awards for my photographs. Mike photographed most of the weddings with me, and was a huge help and a great talent.<h2>2007</h2>2007 was a quiet year of work, visits with family, and Colorado road trips.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615841_f85fV-O-1.jpg\\\">Mike and I get season passes to most of the great resorts each year, but our favorite is Breckenridge.  We skied as much as possible that year, and I finally got brave on the blue slopes.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615836_ghwu9-O-1.jpg\\\">This is one of my favorite photos taken of me while working.  I was very happily shooting a beach wedding in Jekyll Island, Georgia.  I traveled for work several times that year.<h2>2008</h2>2008 was a year of travel.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615861_C2kHx-O.jpg\\\">We got to visit lots of great places that year, including Tampa, Breckenridge, San Diego, Omaha, Corolla NC, Aspen, San Francisco, England, and Germany. I guess my life sounds glamorous when I describe it that way. It isn\\\'t really, but I\\\'m very grateful for any opportunity to see the world.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615838_ooA7w-O.jpg\\\">From a more domestic standpoint, 2008 was our opportunity to remodel our kitchen. We spent eight weeks living in our basement with a microwave while our entire kitchen was recreated from top to bottom. The long wait and endless dust made the final results even more exciting.<h2>2009</h2>The final year of the decade was tougher for a lot of people than it was for us, but still it wasn\\\'t an easy time. The recession took its toll on the luxury industry of professional photography, so I had to work extra hard to keep my business thriving. My continual effort in marketing, planning, and networking helped me to succeed when I could have struggled. Still it wasn\\\'t easy. <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615877_CSoLB-O.jpg\\\">Another hurdle for me was a broken ankle that stole four months of my year. I broke it while jogging on January 5th, proving that New Year\\\'s resolutions must be avoided at all costs. My mother took this photo the day of my injury. I didn\\\'t care about the ice on my ankle because I was surrounded by my dear niece and nephews.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/754615921_hobb6-O.jpg\\\">By April I had resumed normal life. We had a relatively quiet year, but managed to fit in some great trips.  We took a spring time road trip with our dog to Virginia. In June we went wine tasting in Napa. In July we road tripped to Durango. In December we visited Edinburgh, Scotland, which was decorated for Christmas with a layer of snow.<h2>The next ten years</h2>Clearly I have had a great decade, and I feel optimistic about the next one.  My life is happy and full of gratitude.  Still I want more in my life. By the end of the next decade, I hope that photos of the two of us will have become photos of the three of us, or perhaps the four or five of us. I can\\\'t wait to see what happens.','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:05','2010-01-01 20:53:00','A decade in the life of Charlotte','a-decade-in-the-life-of-charlotte.html','/2010/1/01/',1),

The current issue of <i>Newsweek</i> features a cover story called \\\"The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage,\\\" written by George Bush\\\'s lawyer, Ted Olson. Olson is a conservative who represented Bush in the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case, and helped him win the 2000 election. David Boies was the liberal attorney who represented Al Gore in that case. Despite their opposing political views, Olson and Boies have teamed this week in a landmark challenge against Proposition 8. Their goal is to end California\\\'s ban on gay marriage. The trial began yesterday, and is expected to be appealed and eventually presented to the Supreme Court.  Ted Olson\\\'s cover story in <i>Newsweek</i> presents a clear, logical, and compelling discussion of why all Americans should support gay marriage, regardless of political affiliation or religious background. One of my photographs of Karen and Jacynda\\\'s wedding appears on page 50. I am deeply honored that my photograph was chosen to be included in such a significant article, especially one written by one of the most influential people in the gay rights movement. You can read the article here: <a href=\\\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/229957\\\">The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage - Newsweek.com</a> (note: my photo does not appear in the online version).Thank you, <i>Newsweek</i>, for asking me to be a part of such an important article.

Every year I work hard through November and December to prepare holiday orders, and my schedule picks up again after Valentine\\\'s Day.  That leaves me with January to catch up with friends, family, exercise, hobbies, and sleep.  I love the seasonal nature of my job.Last week my mother came to Colorado Springs to visit.  We had a relaxing week together, spending most of our time chatting over coffee, watching girly TV shows, and going out to eat.  On Friday, Mike and I took her to the Olympic Training Center for a tour.  I can\\\'t believe we\\\'d never been there before!  It was fascinating to get a glimpse into the world of Olympic athletes.  I had no idea that some of them live there for a decade or more!The week before, Mike and I went to Nashville for the annual convention of the <a href=\\\"http://www.digitalweddingforum.com\\\">Digital Wedding Forum</a>.  We explored the city, spent time with friends, and took zero photographs.  It must sound ironic not to bring a camera to a photography convention, but occasionally I need to spend time socializing at parties instead of working at them, and exploring a new place without seeing it through a camera lens.  It invigorates me and helps me to see the world differently.Give me a couple more weeks, and I\\\'ll be missing weddings desperately.  For now, I\\\'m loving my down time.It\\\'s been several weeks since I picked up any camera other than my point-and-shoot or my iPhone.

	(736,1,'Last month I asked people to send me questions that they\\\'d like me to answer, and I didn\\\'t get a chance to answer all of them during the holidays.  Sorry, guys!  You can find my answers to questions about photography equipment <a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2009/12/03/qa-camera-equipment-advice/\\\">HERE.</a>  Today I\\\'ll answer questions about post-production.  <b>Foob asks:Do you have any tips for post processing & what do you do to archive your images? (Mine are all over the place & I shoot no where near as frequently as you do.)</b><blockquote>My best tip is to get it right in the camera as often as possible, and reduce the need for post-processing.  If you shoot with good light and correct exposures, you won\\\'t need to do much to the files.  To help keep my photos consistent, I shoot in raw format and batch process photos in Lightroom 2.0.  Raw processing enables me to correct white balance accurately and consistently, and if I do make technical errors in exposure, raw files are much easier to correct than jpegs.  My archive system is a series of hard drives.  My hard drives run in parallel, so whenever I copy files to a drive, they are automatically updated in a mirror drive.  I also store all my clients\\\' photos online at smugmug.com, which has unlimited uploads for only $150 per year.  I keep a final version of everything on DVDs, just in case.  The file structure in my hard drives is based on date.  I keep separate folders for each year, and within each year folder, I keep client folders that are also based on date.  Here\\\'s my naming structure for client folders:2009-01-20 Jane and John Smith2009-02-14 Betty and Barney Rubble2009-02-25 Lois and Peter GriffinWith this naming structure, files are automatically sorted chronologically, and I can always find what I need.  I also use this structure for my personal photos.</blockquote><b>Lolareina asks:1. Do you outsource your edits, or do you personally edit your shoots?2. How do you decide when to keep a photo full-color versus in black and white?</b><blockquote>1. I personally edit my own photos, but this year I plan to start outsourcing my raw processing during my busy summer season.  Editing takes up so much time!  I haven\\\'t yet decided which company I will use.  I\\\'d love any recommendations!2. I tend to prefer color photographs most of the time, because I see the world in color and I photograph my own view of the world.  The photos I present in black and white are often ones in which the color detracts from my intended message.  Emotional photos are often more powerful in black and white.  Moments that occur in cluttered spaces have more clarity and impact in black and white.  Usually, though, I just look at a photo and know instinctively whether I want to convert it to b/w.  I wish I had more of a process to describe, but I just know it when I see it.</blockquote><b>Isabella from Armenia asks:Do you edit your photos yourself? If you do, what software do you use, and how much time on average do you spend on the editing process? </b><blockquote>I do usually edit the photos myself. It takes me about 3-4 days to edit a wedding shoot, which I do in three steps:1. Download files and choose the keepers.  I use <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.camerabits.com/site/\\\"><b>PhotoMechanic</b></a> for this step.  It loads files very quickly and is the fastest way I\\\'ve found to sort through tons of enormous raw files.  At this stage, I also sort the photos chronologically and rename them.  I use the naming structure YYYYMMDD_# (e.g. 20091225_001)2. Process the raw files in <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/\\\"><b>Adobe Lightroom</b></a>. Lightroom enables me to batch process a series of photos to keep colors and exposures consistent.  I also go through each photo individually to make any necessary adjustments in exposure, contrast, color, and cropping.  I use Lightroom to convert the edited raw files to jpegs.3. Choose photos for my blog and/or portfolio, and edit their jpegs in <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/compare/?promoid=BPDEG\\\"><b>Adobe Photoshop</b></a>.  I typically choose about 50 photos from each wedding to put on my blog, and each of those photos is adjusted in Photoshop before I post them.  I will remove blemishes, clone out distracting elements in the background, and run actions that add a little more \\\"pop\\\" to each photo.  Then I prepare web-sized files and blog them.  Meanwwhile, I upload all the complete set of high-resolution files to a web gallery for my clients and their guests.  I back up my files in multiple locations, and start getting ready for the next fabulous wedding. </blockquote><b>Kwanalicious saysHi, I\\\'ve been watching your work for quite some time and I really admire all the beautiful things you\\\'ve been able to capture. I was wondering what kind of post-processing (if any) you do, and if so, what programs do you use? And what\\\'s your general method for post-processing (do you edit colors first, sharpen last, etc.)? Thanks!</b><blockquote>I really do minimal post-processing, at least compared to many other photographers.  I prefer a natural look to my photos, without too much influence by Photoshop.  I try to avoid processing trends, because I worry that trends will look very outdated in just a few years.  Instead, I focus on clean, well-lit photos with just enough contrast and vibrance to give them a little pop.  I do use Photoshop actions to enhance some of my photos, but I try not to make them look like they have had actions applied to them.  My favorite actions are by <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.jeffascough.net/webactions/index.html\\\">Jeff Ascough</a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gettotallyrad.com/\\\">Totally Rad Actions</a>.  I use them in moderation, and to be honest, I only use a few of the actions that are available in each of those sets.  My general method for post-processing is outlined above.  When I\\\'m working with my raw files in Lightroom, I typically edit color balance first.  I find that shifts in color can lead to shifts in exposure, so I adjust exposure second.  Then I take care of any other edits that I might need to do, such as adding contrast or vibrance.  I export the raw files as jpegs, which I then adjust in Photoshop if necessary.  I don\\\'t sharpen the photo proofs at all, but I do sharpen files for the web or for custom print orders.  I like to know exactly what size a photo will be viewed before I sharpen it.</blockquote>I hope this is helpful!

Her parents are <a href=\\\"http://www.realphotography.com\\\">Traci and Nic Turchin</a>, talented wedding photographers here in Colorado Springs.  I was thrilled when Traci asked me to photograph the birth.  It\\\'s always a compliment to be chosen by a fellow photographer, but I was particularly touched by Traci\\\'s request to be there for her family\\\'s first moments with her daughter. Thank you, Traci and Nic, for trusting me to document such emotional and powerful moments.  I hope these photos will always be meaningful to you and Ellie.Traci and Nic left for the hospital around 6:30am on Thursday morning. A snowstorm with low visibility made their drive last three times longer than usual, and by the time they arrived at the hospital, Traci\\\'s labor was well underway.  She used a hypnosis application on her iPhone to calm her through her contractions.  Her husband Nic and his sister stayed by her side the whole time.  After the baby was born, big brother Will arrived with gifts and kisses for his baby sister.Birth is beautiful.  Even during her most agonizing pain, Traci was surrounded by people who love her. I couldn\\\'t help but cry to see such beauty.  When she finally saw her baby, Traci\\\'s joy filled the whole room. When Nic held his daughter for the first time, I had a vision of the two of them dancing at her wedding years from now. I was overwhelmed with the realization that I was documenting the first moments of that special relationship. I love birth photography. If you or someone you know is having a baby in the Colorado Springs area, I\\\'d love to be able to photograph the baby\\\'s first moments.

Now is a great opportunity for a photo tip.  When taking photographs of snow, keep in mind that your camera is designed to expose photographs with an average tone of middle gray.  If a scene is dark, it will brighten the photo to middle gray.  If a scene is bright (like snow), it will darken the photo to middle gray.  So if you are taking snow photographs this weekend, you might notice that your camera is creating dark photographs.  That\\\'s normal and part of the camera\\\'s job.Your job as the photographer is to tell the camera that the photo is supposed to be mostly white, not middle gray.  To do that, you\\\'ll need to set the camera to overexpose by a stop or two. You can probably find that in your camera settings as +1 or +2.  <!--more Here\\\'s an example-->Here\\\'s an example:<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Red Rock Canyon in the snow\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/736105650_4QyGm-O.jpg\\\">It doesn\\\'t look like this here today.

	(743,1,'I know that I still haven\\\'t answered everyone\\\'s questions yet, sorry!  Here are some answers to people\\\'s questions about how I shoot.  Thanks for all the great ideas, guys!<b>Wait asks: I want to knowâ€¦ what is your favorite moment to shoot at a wedding?</b><blockquote>At the end of the ceremony, I follow the couple after they walk down the aisle.  After they walk around a corner out of sight of their guests, there is usually a moment of shock and elation as they realize that they just got married.  All of a sudden the formalities are over and it becomes real.  It\\\'s usually a few seconds of raw emotion, and easily my favorite moment of the day.  I feel especially grateful that I am often the only person to witness it.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/283219997_kbv8L-O.jpg\\\"> <img border=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/313991542_hCf7N-O.jpg\\\"> <img border=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/547776449_5oh7Q-O.jpg\\\"> </blockquote><b>sixpenny_book asks: I would like to know how you get such crisp landscape photos. Mine always seem to be a bit washed out or â€œmistyâ€ looking and Iâ€™m wondering what setting I need to adjust to get a great landscape photo. Thanks! Love the blog!</b><blockquote>The secret to great landscape photos (and photos of all other kinds, too) is the light.  There are usually two times of day when I\\\'m interested in taking landscape photos: just after sunrise, and just before sunset.  Mid-day light creates that washed-out look.  When the sun is low in the sky, colors are more vivid, shadows are more dimensional, and the contrast is higher.  Another point to consider is that digital photos tend to look a bit flat straight out of the camera.  You might want to check your photos\\\' levels or curves in Photoshop, to see if you can add contrast in post-production.</blockquote><b>Lolareina asks: How many pictures total do you usually end up shooting for a portrait session? A wedding (including getting ready, ceremony and reception)?</b><blockquote>I\\\'ll typically take several hundred photos at a portrait session, and a couple thousand during a wedding day. </blockquote><b>Michelle asks:How many photos do you normally show to a couple? i know it can depend upon the wedding, but just an average?</b><blockquote>My final set of proofs is typically 700 for a wedding, and 75 for a portrait session.</blockquote><b>Lolareina asks: Whatâ€™s the most recent picture youâ€™ve taken that, when chimping or going through them on your computer, you get that rush because itâ€™s The Shot?</b><blockquote><a href=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/777181980_Bg9m6-O.jpg\\\">This one</a>.  Traci was holding her daughter for the first time.  The moment was perfect.  I was so happy that I captured it just right. </blockquote><b>Lolareina asks: Have you ever had any outrageous requests?</b><blockquote>Not really, but I do try to present my style and personality clearly before someone chooses to hire me.  I think most people that I work with have read my blog and know what to expect from me, so it works out great.  The only times I\\\'ve had difficulties have been rare occasions when brides have hired me because I\\\'m just what they\\\'re looking for, but their mothers have different ideas of what wedding photography should be.  In situations like that, I smile, do what I\\\'m asked, and then move on to something else.  I\\\'ve never been asked to do anything really weird, though!  I have some funny stories, but you\\\'ll have to buy me a latte to hear them.  ;-)</blockquote><b>Dawntreader90 asks:  Do you try to frame your shots or do you take a hundred fast shots and some come out spectacularly? Iâ€™ve seen some photographers take pictures where they are snapping what sounds like a hundred shots or more a minute. Not that thereâ€™s no value in doing it that way, especially for fast-action shoots. but it seems like if a person always take pictures that way, something decent is bound to come of it sooner or later even if it was 1 shot in 10,000.</b><blockquote>Both.  I frame my shots very carefully, and I take hundreds of fast shots.  You are assuming that it\\\'s an either/or situation, but I very much disagree.  Every picture I take involves thoughtful consideration of exposure, composition, and lighting.  I am photographing real events that occur very quickly, and it\\\'s my job not to miss important moments.  I am also expected to make people look good in the process.  I choose to take multiple frames of many moments, so that I can delete unflattering expressions and make sure that I don\\\'t miss the crucial expression.  I can always delete duplicates later, but if I miss an important moment, I can never recreate it.</blockquote> <b>oh_so_luscious asks:   Do you have any tutorials you recommend for picture tips and tricks?</b><blockquote>I recommend <a href=\\\"http://www.planetneil.com/tangents/\\\">Planet Neil</a> for excellent tips about using flash.  I\\\'ve learned a lot about Photoshop from <a href=\\\"http://www.scottkelby.com/\\\">Scott Kelby\\\'s books</a>.  <a href=\\\"http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/\\\">Joe McNally\\\'s blog</a> is a great resource for photography in general.</blockquote><b>Michelle asks:Do you have any sort of timeline that you like to keep throughout the day? </b><blockquote>Definitely!  My husband jokes that I operate with military precision during a wedding day.  Several weeks before a wedding, I ask the couple for a detailed timeline of the wedding day, along with their photo request list.  I combine that information to create my photography schedule.  As I prepare this schedule, I advise the couple on the amount of posed group photos we can fit into the time they have allotted.  If we won\\\'t have enough time for everything they want, I help them choose additional times for pictures, or I give suggestions to help them cut down their photo request list.  The couple approves the photography schedule before the wedding day, so they know what to expect from me with the timeline they have available.  When the wedding day arrives, I do not have to rely on the couple for any guidance.  I know where I need to be, what pictures I need to take, and what will be happening next. </blockquote><b>Michelle asks:What is your take on first looks? yay, nay? a must?</b><blockquote>This is a great question that couples ask all the time!  I think it\\\'s a tough decision for a lot of people.  My short answer is that it entirely depends on the couple and their own priorities.  I\\\'m happy to work with any schedule that I am given, but I\\\'ll make it clear to the couple what photos they can expect with the schedule they have chosen.  I\\\'m going to write a whole post on this topic, so stay tuned!</blockquote><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Colorado wedding photographer\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/702456633_7kRNC-O.jpg\\\">','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:05','2010-02-11 01:17:00','Q&A: Shooting','qa-shooting.html','/2010/2/11/',1),

	(745,1,'It\\\'s a question that couples ask me all the time: \\\"Should we see each other before the wedding?\\\"  My answer is always, \\\"It\\\'s up to you.\\\"  About half the couples that I photograph choose to have a private meeting before the ceremony. They arrange a time and location to see each other, and I photograph their reactions when they see each other for the first time that day. This meeting has become known as the \\\"first look.\\\" After they\\\'ve had a few private minutes together, we begin the posed portrait session.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/355824859_yVc6C-O.jpg\\\">Tradition states that the groom should not see the bride before the ceremony.  The problem is that this tradition was established before wedding photography became part of the process.  Now couples are faced with a choice: follow tradition, or devote more time to photos?I truly want you to have the type of wedding that is important to you, so I don\\\'t have a preference which option you take.  My style is primarily photojournalistic, so my goal is to document real events as they happen, and I don\\\'t require a lot of time for posing.  I will work with whatever amount of time you give me, but the more time you schedule for posed photos, the more you will have when it\\\'s all over.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/337329512_5djez-O.jpg\\\">There are a few things to consider as you make this decision:<b>Your schedule</b>I tell my clients that I typically need a minimum of an hour for posed photos: 15 minutes for family, 15 minutes for wedding party, and 30 minutes for the couple.  I encourage people to schedule more time than that whenever possible. If your dinner starts an hour after the ceremony ends, that won\\\'t be enough time for an hour of photos.  You also need to plan for time to sign the marriage license, greet people after the ceremony,  travel to the reception site, bustle the gown, and freshen up before entering the reception. An hour and a half is usually a better choice for time between the ceremony and reception, and even more time is needed in certain cases.  If your schedule won\\\'t permit 1.5 hours before the start of the reception, I strongly encourage you to plan for some of your photos before the ceremony. <br><br><b>The sunlight</b>If your ceremony takes place near sunset, there will not be much light available for photos afterward. I can provide portrait lighting, but I won\\\'t be able to illuminate mountain scenery or other aspects of the location that might be important to you.  In this situation, I recommend that you take your portraits before the ceremony.If your ceremony takes place in the middle of the afternoon, though, the sunlight could be harsh and bright beforehand. In this situation, you could be better off scheduling portraits afterward, when the late afternoon sunlight is softer. If you would like to see each other before the ceremony, we could plan the group portraits before the wedding, and plan the couple portraits for afterward.<br><br><b>Your family</b>If you have family members who are older or handicapped, often it\\\'s most appropriate to take the group portraits immediately after the ceremony. If we schedule family photos beforehand, they will have to arrive at least an hour early and spend a lot of time sitting and waiting.<br><br><b>Your guests</b>If you take your posed photos before the ceremony, you will have more time to spend with your guests during the cocktail hour.  You will also have more photos of your guests, because I will be able to photograph them during this time instead of taking posed photos elsewhere.If you decide to schedule your posed photos during the cocktail hour, please don\\\'t worry about neglecting your guests. It is a party for them as well as you, and they will be happy to spend this time chatting with friends and family that they haven\\\'t seen in a while.  Guests understand that the wedding party usually takes photos during the cocktail hour, and they don\\\'t expect the bride and groom to entertain them during this time.<br><br><b>Your nerves</b>The hours before the wedding can be stressful for lots of people.  If you know that you are calmer and happier in the arms of your bride- or groom-to-be, you will probably have more fun on your wedding day if you spend it together.  On my own wedding day, I was a bundle of anxiety until I got to see Mike before the ceremony. He put his arms around me, and I was happy for the rest of the day.On the other hand, if you think you\\\'ll be a bundle of nerves until you say \\\"I do,\\\" then you might not look comfortable and relaxed in pre-wedding portraits.  Waiting until afterward could be a better choice.  This point often applies to mothers, too -- some mothers of the bride are stressed before the ceremony, so consider whether your mom might prefer to wait until afterward for the family photos.<br><br><b>The types of photos that you want to have</b>Several of my photos of brides and grooms are posed, even if they don\\\'t look set up. If you want a  variety of romantic, artistic photos of the two of you, you must plan sufficient time to take them. If you schedule the bare minimum of photo time, I won\\\'t have an opportunity to create the same kinds of portraits for you that I have for other couples.  Years down the road, you will love to look at beautiful portraits of the two of you.  These are the photos that you will frame, and that your children and grandchildren will love to look at someday. Please make sure that you plan enough time to take the photos that will become family heirlooms.','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:06','2010-02-17 21:00:00','Should you do a \\\"First Look\\\" before your wedding?','should-you-do-a-%5c%5c%5c%22first-look%5c%5c%5c%22-before-your-wedding.html','/2010/2/17/',1),

After a day in the Colorado Springs area, my family spent four days in Breckenridge.  The nine of us rented a huge condo right across the street from a ski lift.  We spent our days playing in the snow, and the evenings playing Wii with the kids.  The highlight of the week was teaching the kids to ski.  I guess technically we didn\\\'t really \\\"teach\\\" them -- we just stood them up at the top of a green slope, and let go.  It was beyond adorable to see them on skis, especially my two-year-old nephew, Timmy.  Here are several photos of the adorable mini-skiers!

The <a href=\\\"http://tubbsromptostomp.com/\\\">Tubbs Romp to Stomp</a> is a Susan G. Komen event sponsored by Tubbs snowshoes, where racers ran or walked around the Nordic Center in Frisco, Colorado.  About 2,200 racers turned up in pink clothing, costumes, wigs, or tutus, and raised over $80,000 for breast cancer research.  All day I alternated between laughter and tears. What a brilliant way to raise money for charity and to show support for those affected by cancer. Also I want to take a moment to say for my millionth time that I love Colorado.  It was such a great day yesterday.<!--more More photos from the Romp to Stomp--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\"  alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414773_NeYwG-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414780_8V4TV-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414786_hCDsV-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414794_b29My-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414803_6JPu5-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414808_VSa8E-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414842_YCiBd-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414822_YJidk-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414833_3cyPJ-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414853_ZNvZ6-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414863_xSv88-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414880_zNkgm-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414872_v9mMa-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414881_NEa3S-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414887_iMAd2-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414904_vGUzW-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414901_7A6XU-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414911_Rpt4B-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414918_qTYUy-O.jpg\\\">The survivors<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414924_6H5Uc-O.jpg\\\">The survivors sang \\\"You\\\'ve Got a Friend\\\" along with the band.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414928_M7bDC-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414936_TG48V-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414941_aBYPL-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414950_kczNF-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Tubbs Romp to Stomp snowshoe race in Frisco, Colorado\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/804414964_YLQ93-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:06','2010-03-07 17:24:00','The Romp to Stomp','the-romp-to-stomp.html','/2010/3/07/',1),

	(759,1,'<b>1. Wear clothes that flatter you.</b>  Well-fitting clothes make you look your best.  Dark jeans tend to be more flattering than light jeans. Wear sleeves or a wrap if you\\\'re self-conscious about your arms.  Avoid baggy tops that may make you look bigger. When in doubt, choose a simple outfit and let your face be the focal point of the photos.If you\\\'re selecting a wedding gown, trust the opinion of the salon\\\'s consultant. I can\\\'t tell you how many times a bride has said that she ended up buying a style of gown that she swore she wouldn\\\'t get, because the consultant knew that it would be the most beautiful gown on her figure.  Even the most gorgeous women I know don\\\'t look like the 5\\\'10\\\", size 0 models that appear in fashion magazines, so you need to rely on the mirror and professional advice when choosing your gown.  If you suspect that the salon\\\'s staff are more manipulative than honest, then find a new salon with staff that you trust.<b>2. Wear simple, but effective makeup.</b>  It is a myth that you need to wear heavy makeup for the sake of the camera.  The camera works pretty much the same as a mirror -- if you look good in a mirror, then you\\\'ll look good in pictures.  Make sure that your makeup looks good both indoors and outdoors.  Your makeup shouldn\\\'t look much different from the way that you normally wear it.  You don\\\'t want to look like a different person in your photographs, or else you won\\\'t like the pictures.<b>3. Consider airbrush makeup.</b>If you have any concerns about your complexion, considering hiring an airbrush makeup artist. A skilled professional can conceal pimples, scars, and blotchiness with an airbrush.  It\\\'s remarkable, really.<b>4. Watch out for tanning.</b>I\\\'m a stickler for sunscreen.  Wear it for a couple weeks before your photo shoot, and embrace your natural skin color.  If you really want to be tan for your photos, then do it carefully.  If you are going to tan naturally, make sure that your skin tone is even without tan lines.  If you are going to use a spray-on tan, make sure that your skin doesn\\\'t look orange or streaky.  Another risk of spray tanning is that it can stain wedding gowns if it isn\\\'t done properly.  Something to keep in mind for group portraits, including wedding photos, is that you are likely to be standing next to several members of your family.  If you are the only person in the group who is tan, your skin color may look artificial.  <b>5. Consider the weather when choosing a hairstyle.</b>If you know that your hair gets frizzy in the humidity, you may want to have it professionally blown straight.  If the forecast calls for wind, it could be best to wear your hair up.<b>6. Bring hair pins, lip gloss, blotting papers, and/or a hair brush.</b>You may need to touch up your hair or makeup during a photo shoot, so be prepared.  On your wedding day, have a friend or coordinator carry any items that you may need during the day.<b>7. Even men need tidy nails.</b>Trim or file your nails, and moisturize your hands and cuticles.<b>8. Wear lip balm for a week or so before the photo shoot.</b>If you have dry lips, prepare them with lip balm for several days before your photos are taken. <b>9. Skip the glitter.</b>Sparkly makeup is only effective when seen in person or in video.  Still photographs don\\\'t show sparkle -- instead glitter will look like spots.<b>10. Most importantly, be expressive.</b>No matter how great you look, the success of your photos depends upon your expressions.  I will do everything I can to help you feel comfortable and make the photo shoot fun.  Your job is to laugh, love, enjoy the moments, and feel each emotion deeply.','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:07','2010-04-02 19:45:00','How to look good in photographs','how-to-look-good-in-photographs.html','/2010/4/02/',1),

We flew out a couple days early, and splurged on a lovely room at a lakeside resort. We drove all the way around the lake, and enjoyed several stops along the way.My favorite part of the Tahoe area was that it offered the best of all seasons.  In one day, we saw people skiing, snowboarding, sledding, sailing, scuba diving, and lounging on the beach making sand castles. It must be a wonderful place to live.<!--more More photos of our day at Lake Tahoe--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/844643593_tKisE-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://charlottegeary.smugmug.com/photos/844643603_wAzqG-O.jpg\\\">I couldn\\\'t believe how clear the water was.

We were all heartbroken to learn recently that Idgi has terminal lymphoma. The vet says that she has only a couple more weeks of feeling good before she will start to decline.  Betty and I decided to take some active portraits of Idgi while she\\\'s still feeling good, so we took her to a park to document her favorite thing to do -- play frisbee.  Idgi is a smart, playful, well-loved dog, who has been a true friend to Betty for ten years.  I hope her good days will last longer than any vet could expect.<!--more More of their portraits--><p align=\\\"center\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525054_TaFsR-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525032_PvuEh-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Portrait of a woman and her dog\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525023_igxj2-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525014_ERmed-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Border collie chasing a frisbee\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525005_xN35h-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Woman and a dog playing with a frisbee\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845525010_b7eYn-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Woman and a dog playing with a frisbee\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524975_Hx5Vz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524964_npy3o-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524966_Ke5MX-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Woman and her dog playing frisbee\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524944_btWEb-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Border collie catching a frisbee\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524938_R8ZNz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524930_4XkAB-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524918_fmHJr-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Black and white border collie\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/845524926_mfqLr-O.jpg\\\"></p>','Published','2010-08-29 08:11:07','2010-04-24 15:44:00','Pet portraits in Manitou Springs: Betty and Idgi','pet-portraits-in-manitou-springs-betty-and-idgi.html','/2010/4/24/',1),

Last weekend the three of us decided to take Idgi on an adventure this week, which could be her last.  Sunday morning we packed up Mike\\\'s Jeep with three people, two dogs, and camping gear, and headed west.  Eight hours later, we were in a vast desert wilderness with towering red rock cliffs.  We set up camp next to the Colorado river, and spent our days hiking, 4-wheeling, and sightseeing.  The dogs loved it, of course, and we loved making them happy.

It\\\'s a ton of work to host your own wedding, and Carissa and Adam worked for months to prepare for it.  They grew their own salad greens, made their own cupcakes, grew herbs as party favors, and even made several types of beer.

I\\\'m 13 weeks along right now, and so excited to announce the news.  We\\\'re due January 3, 2011, and everything is going great.The first trimester has been rough.  I\\\'ve been sick pretty much all the time for the last seven weeks.  I had hoped I\\\'d be better by now, but I\\\'ve had no relief yet.  I have days that are better than others, and I\\\'m able to get my work done, so at least that\\\'s good.  Still I wish I could spend more time napping and less time doing anything else.We\\\'ve had no complications, and everything is going exactly as it should.  I\\\'m in good health and the baby is going strong. Due to my so-called \\\"advanced maternal age,\\\" we had genetic screening done last week to determine the baby\\\'s risk of chromosomal anomalies. The hospital called today and said that even though I\\\'m 35, I have the test results of a 20-year-old!  The baby seems to be doing great, and so am I.Mike is thrilled about the pregnancy and has been taking good care of me.  I can\\\'t wait to see him as a father.  If his adoration of me and our dog is any indication, he\\\'ll be a wonderful dad.  I\\\'m so lucky to have him in my life, and our baby will be, too.Here\\\'s a brief synopsis of our first 13 weeks:<img border=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917716419_a3Fu4-L.jpg\\\">4 weeks: We found out while packing the car for a four-day camping trip in Moab.<img border=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917722402_C6HrZ-L.jpg\\\">4.5 weeks: I spent those first few days isolated from the internet, cell phones, and even Barnes and Noble. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. I found a \\\"What to Expect\\\" book at a Walmart on our road trip, and read it in our tent.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917725987_vdi35-O.jpg\\\">10 weeks: Yes, I bawled.

You can see the brain in this picture!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917726858_NKme6-L.jpg\\\">11.5 weeks: Shooting weddings has been ok, despite my constant sickness.  I guess the adrenaline just kicks in and lets me do what I need to do.  (Notice the Sea Band acupressure wrist bands that make me look like an 80s workout video)<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917726868_Xydw4-O.jpg\\\">12.5 weeks: Our gummy bear is looking more like a person!<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917726885_4NhxU-O.jpg\\\">12.5 weeks: Completely amazing.  <img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917727722_cuozJ-L-1.jpg\\\">13 weeks: At the top of Keystone Mountain last weekend, while shooting a wedding.  My belly is definitely poking out!  I didn\\\'t expect to be showing so much already.  Unfortunately I just look fat right now.<img border=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/917800341_HSUtd-L.jpg\\\">13 weeks (today): Excited to announce it to the world.

They had their ceremony on the Schoolmarm ski run outside the Summit House, on the top of Dercum Mountain.  The view of Lake Dillon was breathtaking!  Afterward, we took another gondola ride further into the mountain to their reception at the Alpenglow Stube.  It was the perfect setting for a destination wedding, and a true gem for all the out of state guests.Congratulations, Darice and Grant!

July 30th was our fifth anniversary, so we decided to take a vacation/babymoon to celebrate.  We wanted to go someplace warm and tropical, and completely different from our normal daily routine.  Mike wanted a beach, and I wanted monkeys.  So Costa Rica it was!  We stayed at a miniature resort called the <a href=\\\"http://bluebanyaninn.com/\\\">Blue Banyan Inn</a>, near the town of Quepos and Manuel Antonio National Park.  The Blue Banyan is a bed-and-breakfast owned by an American-Canadian couple named Jim and Barbara.  The Inn has just four cottages, a pool, and a restaurant where they served a delicious breakfast each morning.  It\\\'s quite a bit out of town, nestled in the rolling hills of the rainforest.  The only sounds were those of the birds, insects, and frogs.  The peaceful tranquility was divine, especially during a rare break from my busiest time of year.  One of the greatest aspects of the Blue Banyan Inn is that is also the site of an animal sanctuary operated by a non-profit organization called <a href=\\\"http://www.kidssavingtherainforest.org/\\\">Kids Saving the Rainforest</a>. Barbara and Jim and the volunteers take care of 22 marmoset monkeys at the sanctuary, including these four orphaned babies.  Every morning they would bring the four babies to the hotel, and let me keep an eye on them as they prepared breakfast.  These baby monkeys were absolutely adorable, and one of my favorite parts of the whole trip.I\\\'ll be posting our Costa Rica photos in four sets, starting with these photos of our hotel and the monkey sanctuary.  Stay tuned for more!<!--more More photos of the Blue Banyan Inn and their monkeys--><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423377_yUBjb-O.jpg\\\">The road to the hotel -- it was located about 15 minutes outside of town, along a dirt road through a palm forest.  At this particular moment, we were following Jim and Barbara and their dog, Darla.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Blue Banyan Inn cottage\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423363_wpYNb-O.jpg\\\">Our beautiful cottage<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Blue Banyan Inn\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423353_XnApp-O.jpg\\\">Mike and me<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Blue Banyan Inn pool\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423345_3SizU-O.jpg\\\">The pool at the hotel.

These two were the youngest, at only six weeks old.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423307_orpNW-O.jpg\\\">Barbara and Goober.  Because baby monkeys spend their first several months riding on their mothers\\\' backs, these little orphans loved to sit on Barbara\\\'s head and cling to her hair.  Goober was a total mama\\\'s boy, and would cry for her until she placed him comfortably on her head.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423300_YvWf3-O.jpg\\\">Here she has a couple monkeys on her head.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Baby marmoset monkey\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/960423295_uFwbQ-O.jpg\\\">One of the littlest babies crawled onto my shoulder and took a nap.

Danielle and Jeff got married there alongside a stream, and then celebrated with a dinner for 40 of their closest friends. I loved how the wedding preparations were a group effort -- the cake, flowers, music, and decor were all created by their friends and family.  The staff at Wild Basin Lodge were excellent to work with, and took great care of Jesse and me.  They even offered to accommodate any of our dietary restrictions or allergies, which is a rare treat for wedding vendors. I was truly impressed by the level of their service.

Lauren and Brett are the owners of <a href=\\\"http://themodbo.wordpress.com/\\\">the Modbo Gallery</a> downtown, and you might recognize them from <a href=\\\"http://www.charlottegeary.com/blog/2010/06/17/colorado-springs-engagement-portraits-lauren-and-brett/\\\">their engagement session</a> earlier this summer. They included their artistic skills and stylish creativity in many ways on Saturday.  They even hosted their own reception, by closing down the alley behind the art gallery and celebrating under the stars.Lauren and Brett scheduled a lot of time for posed photos, and as a result, they have lots of gorgeous pictures of the two of them together.  If you love these kinds of pictures as much as I do, please make sure to schedule plenty of time on your own wedding day.  You won\\\'t regret it.Congratulations, Lauren and Brett!<!--more More of their wedding photos--><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891594_qSNAJ-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride in birdcage veil\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891599_VFvB3-O.jpg\\\">Lauren wore a birdcage veil with a peacock feather accent.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bride in birdcage veil and vintage dress\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891609_wKcnN-O.jpg\\\">She wore a vintage, tea length dress.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891620_9Qi6r-O.jpg\\\">Brett and Lauren had a moment together in a private courtyard before the ceremony.<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Fountain Valley School chapel\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891630_UBUUg-O.jpg\\\">The Fountain Valley School chapel<img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Fountain Valley School chapel\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891709_PhoTN-O.jpg\\\">The chapel was decorated in lime green with peacock feathers, along with a grand piano - the perfect touch for Lauren, who is a classical pianist. <img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Fountain Valley School wedding\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891662_XiUbU-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Fountain Valley School wedding\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891660_zcA2q-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Fountain Valley School wedding\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891679_os778-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891687_Djzbz-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891698_SLdzS-O.jpg\\\"><img border=\\\"1\\\" alt=\\\"Bridal bouquet made of antique brooches\\\" src=\\\"http://galleries.charlottegeary.com/photos/979891705_46n5E-O.jpg\\\">Lauren\\\'s bouquet was one of the coolest I\\\'d ever seen.
